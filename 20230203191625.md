# Introduction

This essay is an historical perspective on naturalism and the development of soft light in film. It will aim to investigate the way in which the use of soft light allowed for a more natural and realistic representation of images on screen and how the demand for this kind of image, in turn, pushed the technological advancement and development of soft lighting.  
    
One of the main drawbacks to “this approach to lighting is that it only works well in all-white rooms, particularly” (Salt 1983:253) due to the white paint reflecting the light better and somewhat mitigating the inefficiency of bounce light. 

The second drawback, clearly seen in Le Petit soldat (1963), is that the “eyes of the actors are slightly shadowed” (Salt 1983:253), as seen in Figure \ref{fig:Darkeyes}. This is due to the light coming from the top and is caused by “an absence of ‘catch lights’ [/eye light] showing in the actors’ eye-balls, which are those tiny reflections of the light sources which are conventionally considered to give ‘life’ to the actor’s expression in close shots.” (Salt 1983:253). This is normally solved by using a  “low-wattage light fixture or white bounce card placed close to the camera [to create] a highlight in the eyes” (Box, 2020:60)

One reason why Raoul Coutard was able to shoot using more natural lighting and bounce light was due to his choice of film stock. Although the specific type of film stock used on the film _Le Petit Soldat_ (1963) has not been substantiated, it is known that in Jean-Luc Godard's first film with Coutard, _À bout de souffle_ (1960), Ilford HPS (400 ASA) was utilised, with a "special development" that increased the film speed to 800 ASA (Salt 1983:253). This process provided an extra stop of light, which was critical in Godard's desire to shoot all the scenes on location using available light (Salt 1983:253).

The French New Wave became immensely popular, and Raoul Coutard was the central figure who brought about “these radical changes” (Salt 1983:253), towards more naturalistic cinematography, mainly with his use of bounce lighting. Soon these new techniques were adopted in Europe, and “towards the end of the ’sixties, began to have their first effects on American lighting.” (Salt 1983:253)

## Lighting Technology
Naturalism could only really be achieved when there were technological developments that enabled cinematographers to create soft lighting. This however required a financial incentive which came as Naturalism started to take a hold in commercials. “It was the demands of such [commercial] cinematographers for a softer look” (Deakins, 2017) which was what “influenced what the film equipment manufacturers” (Deakins, 2017) produced. This resulted in “The development of Space Lights” (Deakins, 2017) as well as more efficient Hard lights like HMIs that could be softened.

### Space lights
 
 \vspace{-0.4cm}
 
Oswald Morris is one of the only people in this essay to have come from the traditional studio system. He is known for utilising “a mix of old-school hard light and more modern soft-light techniques” (Mullen, 2017). It was his collaboration with director Carol Reed on the film _Oliver!_ (1968) that brought him to prominence, and his lighting techniques were instrumental in defining the visual style of the film. 

It was “Ozzie Morris who first asked for that kind of soft lighting on Oliver! and … a wonderful electrician called Bill Chitty designed them” (Williams, 2008). Space lights were extremely economical in how they created soft light. They were “like a giant [silk] dustbin with five or six quartz bulbs shooting downwards… with silk underneath so no hard light escaped.” (Williams, 2008) This created “a good exposure and also very soft light, shadowless light” (Williams, 2008). Hanging from a grid on the roof of a soundstage, they provided an ambience and a “general fill throughout the set as opposed to the fill specifically for the actors’ faces.” (Box, 2020:67)

### Appendix A: A definition of realism

“First, it should project a slice of life, it should appear to enter and then leave everyday life. As ‘reality’ it should not use literary adaptations but go for the real. Second, it should focus on social reality: on the poverty and unemployment so rampant in post-war Italy. Third, in order to guarantee this realism, dialogue and language should be natural – even to the point of keeping to the regional dialects. To this effect also, preferably non-professional actors should be used. Fourth, location shooting rather than studio should prevail. And, finally, the shooting should be documentary in style, shot in natural light, with a hand-held camera and using observation and analysis.” (Hayward, 2017:235)

### Appendix A: Soft Lite Discription

The light took the “form of a large sheet-metal box about three feet square on the open side, and with a very irregular interior surface painted matt white. Long quartz-iodine lamp tubes shone onto this surface from behind a narrow baffle that stopped them radiating light directly forward, and after a number of reflections from the white walls, the light emerged from the front opening of the box as a non-directional glow: indeed very like the light emerging through a north-facing window of rather small size.” (Salt, 1992:255)
