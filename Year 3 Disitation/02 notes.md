IS Herzog being self taught a factor in his style staying the same 100 words

  
  

Does upbringing have anything to do with how their films are different

  
  

The two examples given above are perfect examples of how in the early stages both directors have different approaches to film. However, over time their styles evolve and become more related. 

Werner Herzog’s style didn't have the radicle evolve of Nick Broomfield’s, however, to say it didn't evolve at all is being ignorant 

  
  
  
  
  

“Rebellious dwarfs, crazed conquistadors, delusional tycoons, wood-carving ski jumpers” (Colin Marshall, 2017)

  
  
  
  

Over the years Nick Broomfield has altered his style going from conventional cinéma vérité

  
  

“My company was really only an emergency measure simply because no one else would finance my films”(Cronin and Herzog, 2003:11)

  

“I did have access to certain restricted areas and was able to talk to many of the scientists” [(Cronin and Herzog, 2003:20)](https://paperpile.com/c/SdLVV0/n5mQ/?locator=20)

Both filmmakers share a simple need to make films and both filmmakers were picky about their subjects.

“Rather, Herzog (who has made clear in interviews that he believes no state should put a human being to death) sets out to raise the question in a manner at once precise, poignant, and mindful of complexity, through the investigation of a horrific story and its consequences.

The documentary focuses on two men--Michael Perry and Jason Burkett--implicated in a triple homicide in the usually quiet town of Conroe, Texas. The first of the three murders took place in a home within an affluent gated community, where the pair of drugged-up teens allegedly shot a woman in order to steal the family's Camaro. (The car--which is red, the color of desire--is a kind of emblem of covetousness and its tragic destructiveness.) Moving beyond the neighborhood's gates, the teens go on to hunt down and kill the woman's son and one of his friends.

Herzog masterfully incorporates crime-scene footage to evoke the violent interruption of the domestic idyll, as well as the terror of the victims' final moments of life, establishing a sense of horror through the rawness of the images. We find blood spattered on the walls of the house and smeared across the floor; in the background, the television still plays, and lumps of cookie dough lie on the counter, waiting to be put in the oven. Soon after, we see the pale limbs of the woman's body, which has been dumped from the back of a truck and into nearby Crater Lake; her remains are caught up amidst debris and tangled linen from her own bed. And we see the haunting image of a boy's body caught in the dense thicket he had struggled to penetrate in fleeing a killer who would soon shoot him like an animal.

The horror of the crimes is made all the more disconcerting by the interviews Herzog conducts with the perpetrators. At the time of his interview, Michael Perry is eight days from execution. Perry initially comes across as astonishingly cheerful for a man facing imminent execution. He proclaims his Christian faith, saying that "paradise awaits" him. "I'm either going home or going home," he says--either to heaven, if executed, or out of the cell, if his appeal succeeds.” (Biles, 2012) [(Biles, 2012)](https://paperpile.com/c/SdLVV0/xCBm)

Broomfield’s pioneering on-screen appearance began with Driving Me Crazy (1988), a film he described as “hopelessly out of control.” How has this technique influenced Broomfield’s subsequent documentary films? “It enables you to establish more in-depth relationship with people. When filming you show more things than in a feature film, which requires a beginning, middle and end sequence. Appearing in the film gives you the flexibility to include thoughts and flashing of things, contextualising what is happening.” Broomfield elaborates, “The thing that excites me about filmmaking is the spontaneity, I want there to be energy, so that it feels real.”[(Fairweather, 2007)](https://paperpile.com/c/SdLVV0/XGco)

This change in style coincided with Nick Broomfield’s collaboration with Joan Churchill dissolving

  
  

Driving Me Crazy (1990) was the first of a very different kind of film 

  

This change in style occurs at “end of the 1980s (when) Broomfield’s partnership with Churchill dissolves (where) we begin to see him making a very different kind of film.” [(Dovey, 2000:31)](https://paperpile.com/c/SdLVV0/0wXp/?locator=31)

  
  

Around the end of the 1980s Broomfield’s partnership with Churchill dissolves and we begin to see him making a very different kind of film. The origin of the mature Broomfield style (if the word ‘mature’ is not too much of a contradiction in terms here) is to be found in the chaos and hilarity of Driving Me Crazy (1990).   This is a film that sets out to document an allblack musical production based in New York as it rehearses for a European tour. However, events that would formally have remained ‘off stage’ in any conventional Direct Cinema version of the story are allowed to subvert the film entirely. Firstly, the film production is shown constantly being on the verge of running out of money: we see the first of many of Broomfield’s by now famous phone call sequences, in this case 

  

How did this technique influence Broomfield’s subsequent documentary films? - in his own words - “It enables you to establish a more in-depth relationship with people. When filming you show more things than in a feature film, which requires a beginning, middle and end sequence. Appearing in the film gives you the flexibility to include thoughts and flashing of things, contextualising what is happening.” Broomfield elaborates, “The thing that excites me about filmmaking is the spontaneity, I want there to be energy, so that it feels real.” [(Fairweather, 2007)](https://paperpile.com/c/SdLVV0/XGco)

Around the end of the 1980s Broomfield’s partnership with Churchill dissolves and we begin to see him making a very different kind of film. The origin of the mature Broomfield style (if the word ‘mature’ is not too much of a contradiction in terms here) is to be found in the chaos and hilarity of Driving Me Crazy (1990).   This is a film that sets out to document an allblack musical production based in New York as it rehearses for a European tour. However, events that would formally have remained ‘off stage’ in any conventional Direct Cinema version of the story are allowed to subvert the film entirely. Firstly, the film production is shown constantly being on the verge of running out of money: we see the first of many of Broomfield’s by now famous phone call sequences, in this case of his hapless producer trying to hustle up enough cash to carry on shooting. The second is the relentless deterioration of the relationship between Broomfield and the cast of the show. This culminates in a sequence in which Mercedes Ellington, one of the principal dancers in the show, actually collides with the camera during a rehearsal, sparking an extremely bad-tempered row about the incompetence of the camera operator in particular and of Broomfield’s whole production in general. Here, in one sequence, the previous 20 years of Direct Cinema practice is overturned. The camera, supposedly a transparent, invisible window on the world, is not only referred to explicitly, but in an unintentional coup de cinéma , the black subjects of the film deliver a physical blow to the subject/object split that is the epistemological foundation of the Direct Cinema form. The camera and all that it connotes is rendered suddenly visible. The subject/object split has been bridged, albeit somewhat painfully in this case.

  

From that point on Broomfield has not looked back, refining and defining through his productions, by turns, an entertaining and irritating documentary style that is predicated on his own bumbling ineffectual presence as investigator, upon constant reference to the film process itself, and, in his most repetitive device, upon the figure of failing to get the essential interview. In the very funny The Leader, His Driver, and the Driver’s Wife (1991) Broomfield portrays the world of the Broderbond, the Afrikaner neo-fascist

  

movement. The ‘story’ of the film is entirely based around Broomfield’s fruitless attempts to get an interview with Eugene Terreblanche, the neofascist leader of the title. Of course this, thankfully for Broomfield’s method, proves almost impossible and so we spend a good deal of time with the Leader’s driver, family and fascist chums. There are two interlinked features of this film that run throughout Broomfield’s work of the 1990s. The first is the construction of a narrative persona for himself in the films: he comes across as inept, embattled, frustrated, persistent yet not aggressive; on the contrary the moments when ‘Nick gets angry on camera’ are deliberately constructed as narrative climaxes. The most important aspect of the characterisation is that he appears not to be in control. The second feature that will develop from this film throughout the next five films is his technique of giving his subjects ‘enough rope to hang themselves’. His deliberate, constant probing presence and, initially at least, non-confrontational, conversational interview style appears to offer his subjects a safe space in which they can reveal themselves. The Leader for instance contains a surreal sequence in which the driver’s wife, whilst drying up the dishes, talks matter of factly about her husband’s associates’ bomb-making activities whilst denying throughout that their actions could be seen as those of terrorists. It would be tragic if it weren’t funny – and that is just about the point. It manages to be both. (Though how black victims of fascist actions in the crumbling apartheid regime have viewed the film is unrecorded.)

One of the main reasons for questioning if a filmmaker's style is learnt or if it is something that evolves is because Nick Broomfield's style changed from the aforementioned Cinéma Vérité to a Participatory Documentary with his pioneering on-screen appearance in Driving Me Crazy (1988). However this change wasn’t necessarily voluntary as he asked the producers to film the behind the scenes and the making of Driving Me Crazy, since he described the filming as going “hopelessly out of control.” [(Fairweather, 2007)](https://paperpile.com/c/SdLVV0/XGco) 

This trend of appearing in films continued as his career progressed he appeared in 5 out of 5 of his documentaries and the only exception is <ins>i dont know</ins>

  
  

“Some people look at a film like The Great Ecstasy of Woodcarver Steiner and accuse me of self-promotion because I appear in the film. But I was actually forced to make an appearance. The German television network for whom I produced the film had a series called Grenzstationen \[Border Stations\] which had screened some films that were remarkably good. I had to accept that any film I made for the series would have to conform to the network's rules, one of which was that the filmmaker had to appear in the film as the chronicler of events. It is as simple as that, and because ski- jumping is so close to my heart, I did not find it problematic to film myself as the commentator of events.” [(Cronin and Herzog, 2003:179–180)](https://paperpile.com/c/SdLVV0/n5mQ/?locator=179-180)

“In Steiner , Herzog himself takes the role of the narrator and his commentary is always presented either in voice-over narration or in medium shots in which he stands motionless, holding a micro- phone as he directly addresses the camera and the audience. (Needless to say, I am drawing a distinction between this narrator who appears in the film, and Herzog, the filmmaker who directed Steiner.) Much like an announcer in a commercial sports telecast, Herzog in this role dwells on verifiable, precise details - dates, times, the length and speed of Steiner's flights, the exact characteristics of the special skis used in this sporti More important, Herzog's narration attempts to place Walter Steiner's activities within the structure of a traditional, chronological narrative, beginning with Steiner's pre-season training, moving through his loss at Schattenberg, and culminating in his victory at Planica, Yugoslavia. According to this narration, Steiner's story is a simple, albeit suspenseful, quest for victory and a new world record, replete with danger and even idea”[(Waller, 1980:27)](https://paperpile.com/c/SdLVV0/IGau/?locator=27)

  
  

  Getting access 300 words 

  

How do they get access to unusual people/places?

For a documentary, access to information, people, places, things etc. is everything. One would think that two highly established filmmakers would have access to anywhere they would like, however this isn’t true. Both filmmakers have been turned away multiple times and both have made films about trying to get access.  Werner Herzog made a film where he (more info) tried to get close to a volcano that was expected to explode in (La Soufrière - Warten Auf Eine Unausweichliche Katastrophe, 1977)
