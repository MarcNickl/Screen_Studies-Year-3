# Introduction
In this essay i will be looking at how the evolution of soft light and how it plays a major a part of creating a natural looking image. i will look at the main contibutors in the evolution of soft light from 1940's till the 1970's. 

Saying one cinematic movement is responsible for the the entirely of softer lighting in film wouldnt be right. However in film there have been Film Movements that have created noticable change to how we light today. in this essay i will be looking at 4 Major movements. Sarting with Italian Neo Realism then moving onto the avantgard movement in france from 1950 till 1960 going on to the polish film school movement in the same time frame lastly going on to the british new wave from 1960 till the 1970's.


## What is soft light?
To be able to understand the history of soft lighting i will look at the ways soft light is created and the effect it produces Jay Holben discribes this process will in two issues of the American Cinematographer entitled Shot Craft: Light Quality 101 [@holbenLightQuality1012020]


"The closer the source is to your subject, the softer the light will be. As light becomes softer, the shadow transition becomes longer and more gradual. Soft light is, by its nature, very low in contrast_. It can be non-directional and even feel "sourceless," meaning that it's hard to determine what direction the light is coming from. It can hide the texture of an object, even at extreme angles. Extremely soft light can create a nearly shadowless environment." @holbenLightQuality1012020

# Italian Neo Realism 
During an interview in Masters of Light, Néstor Almendros discussed the look of Italian films during the neorealist movement talking about the use of Softer and more natural lighting, mentioning G.R. Aldo (born Aldo Graziati) as one of the most influential people during this time because of his revolutionary work on Umberto D., (1952) and La terra trema, (1949)

Néstor Almendros also discussed where this softer lighting style might have originated "Films of the period like Open City and Shoeshine made by other cinematographers had an interesting look, not because the director of photography wanted it that way; it was due to lack of money." [@schaeferMastersLightConversations2013, 5]






# Post War France Cinema

From 1950 to 1960, France was rife with artistic experimentation, including one of the most influential film movements. The Nouvelle Vague brought upon us the birth of auteur theory. In the age of experimental auteurs, there were also experimental cinematographers, most notably the likes of Raoul Coutard, Henri Decae and Léonce-Henri Burel. 

Although Robert Bresson’s work is not thought to be part being part of the French New Wave, However it still was none the less highly influential in a multiple of ways, his way of lighting being one of them. The lighting in Bressons' films had evolved though multiple films and Cinematographers, two of the most notably being Philippe Agostini and Léonce-Henri Burel. Agostini's films with Bresson had softer elements with elements of softer lighting using the standard techniques of to achieve soft lighting. However, this change with Bressons' collaboration with Léonce-Henri Burel where this technique was used to a far greater extent, most notably on the films Diary of a Country Priest (1951), A Man Escaped (1956) and Pickpocket (1959).

look at the catch light used in A Man Escaped and how it gave life to the image

the ineficency of lights and how they arnt very light efficent so they need stong lights to power

(soft light was used since the being of cinema how)

> _"It's interesting to look at the work of Geoffrey Unsworth and Ozzie Morris because they came out of the British studio system and their lighting styles was always a mix of old-school hard light and more modern soft-light techniques -- and then compare them with someone like David Watkin who came out of shooting industrials, documentaries, and commercials. Also, look at Unsworth's work on "2001" (1968), which is mostly soft-lit" [@davidmullenWhenDidSoft2017]_
