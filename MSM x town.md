Filming Guests walking into the Shop looking at a range of Products 


## Goals\

Capture the excitement of the enthusiastic customers walking into the shop, looking at the products on display, interacting with one and other, getting advice from the staff & showcasing the wide range of exciting products on display. 

In the evening, capturing the guestâ€™s anticipation as they arrive and are greeted. The focus will then be on representing the lively interaction amongst the guests, the food and beverages being served by the waiters. Finally, we will film, the guests enjoying their food as much as each other company.
