A Hidden History of Film Style is the first study to focus on the collaborations between directors and cinematographers, a partnership that has played a crucial role in American cinema since the early years of the silent era. Christopher Beach argues that an understanding of the complex director-cinematographer collaboration offers an important model that challenges the pervasive conventional concept of director as auteur. Drawing upon oral histories, early industry trade journals, and other primary materials, Beach examines key innovations like deep focus, color, and digital cinematography, and in doing so produces an exceptionally clear history of the craft. Through analysis of several key collaborations in American cinema from the silent era to the late twentieth century\textemdash such as those of D. W. Griffith and Billy Bitzer, William Wyler and Gregg Toland, and Alfred Hitchcock and Robert Burks\textemdash this pivotal book underlines the importance of cinematographers to both the development of cinematic technique and the expression of visual style in film.},

Ben-Ghiat sees these films as part of the aesthetic development that would lead to neo-realism. Shot in Libya, Somalia, and Ethiopia, these movies reinforced Fascist racial and labor policies and were largely forgotten after the war. Ben-Ghiat restores them to Italian and international film history in this gripping account of empire, war, and the cinema of dictatorship.},

Japan's "pure film movement" of the 1910s is widely held to mark the birth of film theory as we know it and is a touchstone for historians of early cinema. Yet this work has been difficult to access because so few prints have been preserved. Joanne Bernardi offers the first book-length study of this important era, recovering a body of lost film and establishing its significance in the development of Japanese cinema. Building on a wealth of original-language sources\textemdash much of it translated here for the first time\textemdash she examines how the movement challenged the industry's dependence on pre-existing stage repertories, preference for lecturers of intertitles, and the use of female impersonators.Bernardi provides in-depth analysis of key scripts\textemdash The Glory of Life, A Father's Tears, Amateur Club, and The Lust of the White Serpent\textemdash and includes translations in an appendix. These films offer case studies for understanding the craft of screenwriting during the silent era and shed light on such issues as genre, authorship and control, and gender representation.Writing in Light helps fill important gaps in the history of Japanese silent cinema. By identifying points at which "pure film" discourse merges with changing international trends and attitudes toward film, it offers an important resource for film, literary, and cultural historians.},

This is a book about the art of lighting, "the relevance of pictures, and the responsibility of all those who take pictures of the world and show them". In an age of constant digital snapshots, with their mercilessly artless recording of everything around us, the award-winning director and scriptwriter Richard Blank makes a compelling case for this increasingly neglected art, and for sustaining "the awareness of its responsibility". In Film \& Light, Richard Blank draws on examples from a century of pioneering filmmakers - from Griffith to Bu\~nuel, Oph\"uls to Altman, Rossellini to Scorsese, Eisenstein to Wong Kar-Wai - to trace the historical development of lighting technology, analyse the changing "rules" and techniques of film lighting, and define the key terms surrounding the technical innovations of its art. The close attention he brings to bear on these modern masters - from DeMille to De Sica to Lars von Trier, Niblo to Murnau to Siodmark, via Maurice Tourneur and Fritz Lang, Charlie Chaplin and Orson Welles - brilliantly illuminates the hidden art of these past masters, as well as the troubled social context by which they each variously came to shine.},

  abstract = {According to the American Film Institute, La Strada is one of the most popular films in cinema history. The performances of Giulietta Masina as the waif Gelsomina, Richard Basehart as the Fool, and Anthony Quinn as the strongman Zampano, who buys Gelsomina from her mother and takes her with him on the road, have been acclaimed for their power and sometimes ridiculed for their sentimentality. The debates over what these characters and the story they enact represent--a Christian parable, a journey of self-discovery, a tale of beauty and the beast--and the position of the film within the neo-realist genre, continue today. This new translation and critical edition of the continuity script for La Strada is the only accurate guide to the film in any language. The notes to the shooting script enable the reader to reconstruct some of Fellini's changes while shooting the film. The edition also contains an introduction which analyzes the work's place in film history and within the so-called "crisis of neo-realism," and provides for the first time in English a number of articles on the film's production. Fellini's most important interviews and statements on La Strada are included as well. Finally, two of the best critical analyses of the film, by Frank Burke and Peter Harcourt, are reprinted, along with a number of the contemporary reactions by critics from France (Andre Bazin), Italy (Guido Aristarco), and the United States--including a description of its reception at the Venice Film Festival. The illustrations include some of Fellini's original drawings made during the shooting of the film.},

This study re-examines the director's postwar works in relation to the contemporary discussion on Italian national identity: rather than marking a radical break with the director's early neorealist successes, Rossellini's films with Bergman in fact extend the boundaries of neorealism and challenge the standard reading of its basic tenets, especially the relationship between character and setting.  Gelley reassesses the relationship between European postwar and American cinema, looking at how the image of the Hollywood star was translated and transformed when it was imported into Rossellini's Italy. Rossellini's insertion of the Hollywood star into the native landscape had a significant influence on the director's approach to the neorealist aesthetic. His filming of the encounter between Bergman and the Italian landscape involves not only a re-interpretation and transformation of the Hollywood star persona, but also a challenge to the idealized notion of an authentic Italian national collective free of foreign influence. The disruption of Bergman's character into the Italian landscape became one means whereby the director was able to explore the ambivalence inherent in any attempt to construct a national identity.},

Its chapters, illustrated with more than 130 black and white images and an eight-page colour section, explore how Italian literature, cinema, popular culture, and politics have engaged with the medium of photography over the course of time.The collection includes topics such as Futurism's ambivalent relationship to photography, the influence of American photography on Italian neorealist cinema, and the connection between the photograph and Duchamp's concept of the Readymade. With contributions from writer and theorist Umberto Eco, photographer Franco Vaccari, art historian Robert Valtorta, and cultural historian Robert Lumley, Stillness in Motion engages with crucial historical and cultural moments in Italian history, examining each one through particular photographic practices.},

Because of the sharp, well-defined shadows it creates, it's fairly simple to place objects - such as flags - into its path to cut light off of areas you don't want it to hit. Putting flags in front of a soft source, however, can be a lot like trying to stop an ocean wave with a 2x4. Because light is scattering in all directions, getting a clean, sharp cut from a soft source ranges from difficult to impossible. The Inverse-Square Law \& Photometries As there is a direct relationship between quality of light and distance to the source, we start to touch upon a law of physics called the inverse-square law, which states that the energy (of light, in this case) will diminish by the square of the distance traveled. Intensity = 1/d2 The formula and physics technically only apply to point sources; these are sources without lenses to focus the light, without diffusion, and that derive from a single point - like tungsten or HMI lamps, as opposed to fluorescent (a large light source that is not one point) or LED (a multiple-point source).},

"Because most diffusion is 'white,' we usually think of it as being 'neutral' in color, but that isn't really the case. The quality of light is created by the size of the light source relative to the subject, but if our diffusion material isn't wholly opaque and we can still see some of the original source behind that material, then the actual fixture - in addition to the "new" light source created by the diffusion - has an effect on the overall quality of light.},

Examining every facet of this understated art form, from the glowing backlights of the silent period to the shaded alleys of film noir, Patrick Keating affirms the role of Hollywood lighting as a distinct, compositional force.Closely analyzing Girl Shy (1924), Anna Karenina (1935), Only Angels Have Wings (1939), and T-Men (1947), along with other brilliant classics, Keating describes the unique problems posed by these films and the innovative ways cinematographers handled the challenge. Once dismissed as crank-turning laborers, these early cinematographers became skillful professional artists by carefully balancing the competing demands of story, studio, and star. Enhanced by more than one hundred illustrations, this volume counters the notion that style took a backseat to storytelling in Hollywood film, proving that the lighting practices of the studio era were anything but neutral, uniform, and invisible. Cinematographers were masters of multifunctionality and negotiation, honing their craft to achieve not only realistic fantasy but also pictorial artistry.},

  abstract = {The movement known as neorealism lasted seven years, generated only twenty-one films, failed at the box office, and fell short of its didactic and aesthetic aspirations. Yet it exerted such a profound influence on Italian cinema that all the best postwar directors had to come to terms with it, whether in seeming imitation (the early Olmi), in commercial exploitation (the middle Comencini) or in ostensible rejection (the recent Tavianis). Despite the reactionary pressures of the marketplace and the highly personalized visions of Fellini, Antonioni. And Visconti, Italian cinema has maintained its moral commitment to use the medium in socially responsible ways--if not to change the world, as the first neorealists hoped, then at least to move filmgoers to face the pressing economic, political, and human problems in their midst. From Rossellini's Open City (1945) to the Taviani brothers' Night of the Shooting Stars (1982). The author does close readings of seventeen films that tell the story of neorealism's evolving influence on Italian postwar cinematic expression. Other films discussed are De Sica's Bicycle Thief and Umberto D. De Santis's Bitter Rice, Comencini's Bread, Love, and Fantasy, Fellini's La strada, Visconti's Senso, Antonioni's Red Desert, Olmi's Il Posto, Germi's Seduced and Abandoned, Pasolini's Teorema, Petri's Investigation of a Citizen above Suspicion, Bertolucci's The Conformist, Rosi's Christ Stopped at Eboli, and Wertmuller's Love and Anarchy, Scola's We All Loved Each Other So Much provides the occasion for the author's own retrospective consideration of how Italian cinema has fulfilled, or disappointed, the promise of neorealism.},

This term, coined by the production designer Yoshino Nobutaka, refers to the perception that shadows add depth and mystery. Miyao analyzes how this notion became naturalized as the representation of beauty in Japanese films, situating Japanese cinema within transnational film history. He examines the significant roles lighting played in distinguishing the styles of Japanese film from American and European film and the ways that lighting facilitated the formulation of a coherent new Japanese cultural tradition. Miyao discusses the influences of Hollywood and German cinema alongside Japanese Kabuki theater lighting traditions and the emergence of neon commercial lighting during this period. He argues that lighting technology in cinema had been structured by the conflicts of modernity in Japan, including capitalist transitions in the film industry, the articulation of Japanese cultural and national identity, and increased subjectivity for individuals. By focusing on the understudied element of film lighting and treating cinematographers and lighting designers as essential collaborators in moviemaking, Miyao offers a rereading of Japanese film history.},

  note = {Earliest silent movies were shot in studios under glass roofs with muslin cloth stretched across, so were under soft light. One of the most popular lights in the silent era were Cooper-Hewitts, which were gas-discharge fixtures in tubes, a cross between a mercury vapor streetlamp and a fluorescent tube, and produced a soft light. Cinematographers like Charles Rosher did lovely lighting effects by mixing hard carbon arc lamps with soft Cooper-Hewitt lamps. So soft lighting is not a modern phenomenon.
\par
Sound killed the use~of the noisy Cooper-Hewitts~(as did color). But many 1930's movies still created soft lighting using tungsten lamps through spun glass or silks. By like all styles, people became tired of it and the sharper, crisper look using harder lights become the norm by the 1940's.
\par
Soft lighting started reappearing in the work of the French New Wave and also in England from DP's like Ozzie Morris, late-1950's through the~1960's.
\par
It's sort of a side benefit that soft lighting is more generalized in a space allowing actors to move more freely, or for the blocking to be changed in the last minute. The main reason it re-emerged is that soft light is one aspect of natural light and in the light depicted~in~paintings (based on natural light) and thus filmmakers were interested in recreating it or capturing it for real. It's too limiting to only use hard lighting or only soft lighting.

After analyzing how this aesthetic develops and manifests itself in the early works, Nelson devotes individual chapters to Lolita, Dr. Stangelove, 2001: A Space Odyssey, A Clockwork Orange, Barry Lyndon, and The Shining. For this expanded edition, Nelson has added chapters on Full Metal Jacket and Eyes Wide Shut, and, in the wake of the director's death, reconsidered his body of work as a whole.

Most of the films discussed in this book, with the exception of Vertigo, The Searchers and The Red Desert, were shot in black-and-white. My bias was not a conscious one. It was determined by my tastes and by the fact that many of the generally accepted film classics were made in the black-and-white era. It may even be the case that black-and-white cinema constitutes a stylistic category, one that crosses national boundaries, genres and even artists. My emphasis has been on Eisenstein's cinema, Dreyer, Italian neo-realism, Hitchcock and Ford, in all of whom black-and-white cinematography plays a large part. The monochromaticism of cinema's greatest achievements (I am excluding early tinted film)2 includes the major films of Eisenstein, much of Ford, Hitchcock, Wilder, Capra, Welles, Hawks, Fuller, the two Rays, Pabst, Lang, Renoir, Mizoguchi, Vertov, Vigo, Bunuel, Deren, Dreyer, Ozu \textemdash{} the list is endless.

``Aldo (Aldo Tonti) was even before Raoul Coutard in using indirect lighting, using soft lighting. And I think that's because he came to motion pictures from still photography. He came to the cinema not through the usual way of the period, which was to be a loader, an assistant, a focus puller, a cameraoperator, and after all that, many years later becoming a director of photography. He came straight from still and theatrical photography and only because Visconti imposed on him.'' (Schaefer and Salvato, 2013, p. 6)},

  abstract = {The end of the Second World War saw the emergence of neorealist film in Italy. In Italian Neorealist Cinema, Christopher Wagstaff analyses three neorealist films that have had significant influence on filmmakers around the world. Wagstaff treats these films as assemblies of sounds and images rather than as representations of historical reality. If Roberto Rossellini\&\#39;s Roma citt\`a aperta and Pais\`a, and Vittorio De Sica\&\#39;s Ladri di biciclette are still, half a century after they were made, among the most highly valued artefacts in the history of cinema, Wagstaff suggests that this could be due to the aesthetic and rhetorical qualities of their assembled narratives, performances, locations, lighting, sound, mise en sc\`ene, and montage. This volume begins by situating neorealist cinema in its historical, industrial, commercial and cultural context, and makes available for the first time a large amount of data on post-war Italian cinema. Wagstaff offers a theoretical discussion of what it means to treat realist films as aesthetic artefacts before moving on to the core of the book, which consists of three studies of the films under discussion. Italian Neorealist Cinema not only offers readers in Film Studies and Italian Studies a radically new perspective on neorealist cinema and the Italian art cinema that followed it, but theorises and applies a method of close analysis of film texts for those interested in aesthetics and rhetoric, as well as cinema in general.},

Our memories of films are composed of the moments we deem to be crucial: touchstones for our understanding and appreciation. Moments matter.The 38 specially commissioned essays in Film Moments examine a wide selection of key scenes across a broad spectrum of national cinemas, historical periods and genres, featuring films by renowned auteurs including Alfred Hitchcock, Jean Renoir and Vincente Minnelli and important contemporary directors such as Pedro Costa, Zhang Ke Jia and Quentin Tarantino, addressing films including City Lights, Gone with the Wind, The Wizard of Oz, The Night of the Hunter, Wild Strawberries, 8 1?2, Bonnie and Clyde, Star Wars, Conte d'\'et\'e, United 93 and Lord of the Rings: Return of the King.Film Moments provides both an enlightening introduction for students to the diversity of approaches and concerns in the study of film, and a dynamic and vibrant account of key film sequences for anyone interested in enhancing their understanding of cinema.},
