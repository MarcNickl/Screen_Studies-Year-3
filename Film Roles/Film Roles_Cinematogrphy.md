NB: This option can only be shot on Digital

Camera Lighting Research and Production Planning Assessment Project requirements

- A treatment indicating visual style and approach  
Research material,visual references for style & technical approach (mood board)
- Storyboard to indicate shot construction, planning and testing notes for camera and lighting, exposure and contrast notes, and recce stills

- Equipment lists for camera and lighting to include consumables and props 
- Lighting plans to include camera position  
- Ungraded and Graded version of two key images from the film  
- A final edited version of the film min duration one min, max duration 2min\

this is utter madness needs to be a lot cleaner

# Equipment Lists

\pagebreak

# Testing Notes

## Tests Required

### Lens Tests


### Defusion Tests


### Green Screen Test\
To see and try out possible ways of exicuting the transision from Shadow to light\

   One option would be to adust the green colour channels when converting from Colour to Black and While and just removing the shadow with an alteration in lighting


\pagebreak






# Lighting Plans

\pagebreak






# Colour Grade


## Look
I like the look of imperfect blacks maybe with a slight cast towards blue



## Process
A colour to Black and while conversion Allows me to alter the colour wheels in post allowing of a greater range of versatility to achieve a curtain look. this will have to be tested with the possibility of using a green screen.
