A percentage mark will be awarded for each component with the final mark at the end of the unit comprising an aggregate of the two. Each assessment component essay must be submitted by the specified deadline on myUCA Turnitin see here for more information http://www.uca.ac.uk/library/academic-support/plagiarism-and-turnitin/ 
A 1000 word (+ / - 10%) written film analysis and 5-item bibliography. LO1 Relate knowledge and understanding of a range of fundamental concepts of moving 
image history and theory to a moving image text. LO3 Accurately and effectively use a range of appropriate academic research and study 
skills to produce analyses of moving image texts. 
Film Analysis Essay Brief 
Select either one short (less than 15 minutes long) silent film or a sequence of less than 15 minutes from a longer silent film made between 1895 and 1929. Many short silent films are available as part of DVD compilations, so you need to select one film from the compilation. 
After watching your chosen film, find four published sources of information about film language, grammar and mise-en-scene, silent cinema and the film you have watched. Use these research sources to help you write a short (1000 word) analysis of the film’s mise-en-scene, employing appropriate film language and grammar, to demonstrate how the film visually tells its story. Sound should not be included. You should find and use the following types of information: 
	•	Two academic books  
	•	One refereed (also known as peer reviewed) journal article accessed through the  Library’s print and e-journals search  
	•	One journal article of any kind accessed through the library  Your analysis should be based on the ideas and information contained within the four research sources. These four sources, along with the film you have analysed, should form the five-item bibliography. The bibliography should be placed at the end of your work and must be set out in accordance with the UCA Harvard referencing style. The UCA Harvard referencing style must also be used to acknowledge the sources of all direct quotations used and any ideas used that have been found in primary and/or secondary research sources.  
	•	You will be introduced to the library’s resources in research seminars as part of this unit.  
	•	You will be introduced to the Harvard referencing system in writing seminars as part of  this unit.  
	•	You will be introduced to ideas about mise-en-scene and some of the fundamental concepts of film language and grammar in the lectures and screenings as part of this unit.  This assessment task is designed to  
	•	Help you familiarise yourself with the research sources available via the library  
	•	Enable you to use the appropriate academic conventions for citations and referencing  
	•	Use research sources to find out about a subject area and apply that information to produce a short film analysis  
	•	Enable you to become an independent learner  
All essays must start with the following sentence: In this essay I will be analysing [insert title of film and date in ( )]. The aspects of mise-en- scene to be focused on are [insert aspects of mise-en-scene here]

Give a definition of mise en scène at the beginning of the essay 

Attach mise en scène to a peticular theorist 

Brian Henderson

Murnau, Ophuls, and Welles are celebrated metteurs en scène, that is, practitioners of the art of mise-en-scène. One does not lightly venture a definition of mise-en-scène, cinema's grand undefined term, of which each person, when examined, reveals a different sense and meaning. (To the problem "What is Mise-en-Scène?" Astruc devotes a brilliant essay which nevertheless fails to answer the question.) The term is originally a theatrical one meaning literally (to) put in place. It is, baldly, the art of the image itself- the actors, sets and backgrounds, lighting, and camera movements considered in relation to themselves and to each other. Of course the individual images of montage have or exhibit mise-en-scène. But it is generally thought that the true cultivation and expression of the image as such- as opposed to the relation between images, which is the central expressive category of montage- requires the duration of the long take (a single piece of unedited film, which may or may not constitute an entire sequence). Opinion aside, it is the long take alone which permits the director to vary and develop the image without switching to another image; it is often this uninterrupted development that is meant by mise-en-scène. Thus the long take makes mise-en-scène possible. The long take is the presupposition or a priori of mise-en-scène, that is, the ground or field in which mise-en-scène can occur. It is the time necessary for mise-en-scène space.</Text>

            <Text>Synopsis

The film starts in a briefing room on board an American ship called the USS Enterprise heading to japan in seek of revenge for the bombing of pearl harbour that happened less than a year prior.
James Doolittle (protagonist) is giving the final briefing before the start of the mission. Little does he know that the ship was just spotted by a Japanese spy boat.
the ship intersects the radio message back to Tokyo and James Doolittle has to make the choice of returning to allies territory or taking off as soon as possible with the high risk of not making it back as they might run out of fuel on the way back.
the decision was made to continue with the mission despite the setback.
so 16 planes take off 8 of them are heading directly for Tokyo with James Doolittle leading.
shortly after they enter in Japanese air space they are engaged in substantial fire from ground to air missiles luckily however they all make it out however they are lower on fuel than expected and might have to divert to Russia where there is no guarantee that they will make it home or take the risk and try to make it to china.
it’s put up for a vote and the crew alongside choose to take the more dangerous route as the chance of being imprisoned in a Japanese war camp is said to be worse than death.
shortly after the engines have started to splutter and stopped spinning, they see the Chinese mainland.

            <Text>Goals 
I want to show how soft light was used to create the feeling of realism in mid century European cinema. To further understand this I want to analyse the progression and use of soft light by looking a key films and contributors within realist movements.   

From my current research ive found a lot of the development has come from either necessity or another field like photography, photojournalism or Documentary work.


Introduction

This project looks at the evolution of soft light. I will look at how soft light evolved and how it is used to create a natural-looking image. To further understand its historical evolution, I will look at some of the key cinematographers who have used and contributed to the evolution of soft light and how they used it to create more realistic images. I will focus on three film movements and periods, among other influences, from 1940 to the 1970s.

I choose these periods as I believe the most of the long lasting change in regards to soft lighting happened within  this time. This is also when some of the most influential movements took place creating some of the most progressive films in the process.  

The movements I will look at are Italian neorealism, French cinema from 1950 to 1960 and British kitchen sink/new wave from 1960 to the 1970s. I will also look at individuals and smaller movements that have used realism to great effect, like the director Ingmar Bergman and the Polish Film School movement.

Whilst soft lighting is a naturally occurring phenomenon that has been used in cinema since the beginning, the goal behind using it has not aMISCMISClways been realism. How it is used has a great impact on the image, resulting in totally different effects, going from a more realistic look to the opposite effect, which is unrealistic, having no shadows at all.

In Fish Tank (2008). Figure \ref{fig:FishTank} we have a good example of the realistic look of a room where sunlight and shadows are scattered into the room and one cannot see where the light affecting the subject is coming from.

\end{figure}

The opposite to this would be The Construct in The Matrix (1999) Sourceless nature of The Construct is a perfect example of how soft light can have the polar opposite effect by having no visible shadows or light source.

\end{figure}


What is soft light?

To understand the history of soft lighting, I will first look at the ways in which soft light is created and the effect it produces.  Jay Holben describes this process well in an article from the American Cinematographer entitled Shot Craft: Light Quality 101 [@holbenLightQuality1012020]. Holben states that "The closer the source is to your subject, the softer the light will be." [@holbenLightQuality1012020]. As the light appears less directional and more scattered, it has the effect of lowering the contrast of the item being illuminated; this results in lower contrast as seen in Figure \ref{fig:ASC101}.


#
\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
\includegraphics[width=0.8\linewidth]{/Users/marc_nickl/Documents/__Screen_Studies-Year-3/IMG/Screenshot 2022-12-01 at 15.08.40.png}
\caption{\textit{Light Quality 101} (2020)}
    \label{fig:ASC101}
\end{figure}

As light becomes softer as the photons become more scattered "the shadow transition becomes longer and more gradual." [@holbenLightQuality1012020] this results in creating a "nearly shadowless environment" [@holbenLightQuality1012020], This is because of the light being heavily scattered, so that it is difficult to determine where the light originates from.

There are two primary ways of increasing the size of the source. One of them is Photon diffusion, the other is Diffuse reflection. Photon diffusion, also known as ‘through lighting’ or ‘diffused lighting’, works by having a larger piece of partially transparent cloth that doesn't absorb all light, therefore scattering in with a reduction in intensity. The other way is called Photon diffusion, also known as ‘bounced light’. This is where light is bounced into a larger piece of more reflective cloth. Both of these methods increase the size of the light source[^a] therefore softening the light.

One of the main benefits for the production is that "soft lighting is more generalised in a space allowing actors to move more freely, or for the blocking to be changed at the last minute." [@mullenHistoryHardSoft2012] This allows for faster turnarounds for filming and a more natural performance as the actor is not restricted to their marks. Another benefit of soft lighting is that it produces “more flattering effects” [@allisonLightingTechnologyFilm2007]  in facial lighting, as that hides blemishes on the actor’s face. This is due to the lower contrast nature of soft light. This was especially important during the star system of the 1910’s where it was “ever more important to make the actors look attractive” [@allisonLightingTechnologyFilm2007].

The two inherent drawbacks from the process of softening light is that the light becomes less controllable as it scatteries everywhere, in a blog post Roger Deakins has stated that “the control of a bounce source is often an issue” and that he uses “a system of 'louvers' which I create using multiple small flags.” [@rogerdeakinsRogerDeakinsASC2013]

The other drawback is the power draw to achieve the same luminance on set is drastically increased, this was one of the main reasons why light diffusion was used before the invention of Tungsten lamps as carbon arcs and Cooper-Hewitt lamps were less power efficient.

That being said (talk about how the Cooper-Hewitts lamps were used then transition into pre realism and the start of realism)


"Earliest silent movies were shot in studios under glass roofs with muslin cloth stretched across, so were under soft light. One of the most popular lights in the silent era were Cooper-Hewitts, which were gas-discharge fixtures in tubes, a cross between a mercury vapor streetlamp and a fluorescent tube, and produced a soft light. Cinematographers like Charles Rosher did lovely lighting effects by mixing hard carbon arc lamps with soft Cooper-Hewitt lamps. So soft lighting is not a modern phenomenon."   [@mullenHistoryHardSoft2012]

"Silent films of the 1920's used a mix of hard and soft light, and even though the load Cooper-Hewitts were discontinued once sound movies began, replaced by banks of tungsten lamps, you had a generally soft style of lighting through the 1930's, it wasn't until the late 1930's that a nearly all hard-light style emerged.  A lot of this was just a shift in style, people got tired of the soft 30's look, which combined lower-contrast, softer lighting with diffusion on the lens." [@mullenHistoryHardSoft2012]

"Sound killed the use of the noisy Cooper-Hewitts (as did colour). But many 1930's movies still created soft lighting using tungsten lamps through spun glass or silks. By like all styles, people became tired of it and the sharper, crisper look using harder lights become the norm by the 1940's" [@mullenHistoryHardSoft2012]





This sourcelessness can be used to either create a natural looking image for example in


When using softer lighting in a film there are some inherent benefits and drawbacks. --— in his essay puts it best

One of the major drawbacks to using softer lighting from a non artistic point is that it requires a lot more light to get a good exposure.

the second major drawback is that soft light by its very nature is uncontrollable

from my understanding roger deakins uses bounce light and then flags and card to control the spill off the light





The Drawbacks
greater power requirements as

would this work if this doesn't works
just one more test


Pre Realism soft light

look at the use of soft light before the realist movements

looking at the soft 1930's and lens filters and soft light's use before realism


"Director D. W. Griffith (1875-1948) was one of the first to explore the use of cameras and lighting to help heighten the mood of a film—it often being cited that Enoch Arden, released in 1911, introduced soft lighting on faces as a technique. This is usually created by bouncing or diffusing the light source of a shot, ensuring there are no harsh shadows on the person or object being lit. Soft lighting makes a shot more appealing to a viewer and tends to be used for happier and upbeat scenes.

“From this point onwards, lighting, as we know it in cinema, became heavily stylized and rarely reflected the true reality of a situation. Instead, lighting acts as a visual representation of what we think certain emotions or scenarios would look like." [@ArtLightingHistory]




Seen in Der letzte Mann (1925) shot by Karl Freund used soft light long before Italian neorealism  soft lighting has been around long before

The start of realism

Hope to look into the start of Realism as a movement looking at Cenere [@mariCenere1917] and Sperduti nel buio [@martoglioSperdutiNelBuio]

before the war and other possible points for the movement to start

It is important to mention the increase in film speed ASA this allowed for less lighting helping decrease the high power draw required by Bouncing or defusing the light.


Realism and Popular Cinema
“One person’s ‘realism’ is just another person’s fantasy. }” (Hallam and Marshment, 2000, p. 14)
“By 1911, reviewers were criticising filmmakers for not bringing actors close enough to the camera: the face and eyes were thought to reflect characters’ thoughts and emotions, and therefore facial expression was considered an indispensable part of the verisimilar code’s construction of a psychological character (Pearson 1992: 125-7).” (Hallam and Marshment, 2000, p. 39)
“Since the construction of everyday life depends upon an apparent stripping away of artifice, choices about lighting and film stock aim to replicate the appearance of genres closely associated with the everyday and the ordinary.” (Hallam and Marshment, 2000, p. 126)

"Andre Bazin, proclaimed neo-realism as a cinema of "fact" and "reconstituted reportage" which rejected both dramatic and cinematic conventions and which "respected" the ontological wholeness of the reality it captured, just as the narrated screen time in neo-realist films often "respected" the actual duration of the story."

Italian Neo Realism 2000 words total target
	•	I aim to bring across how the natural look started almost by accident due to the environment around ( basically nature vs nurture) show how the whole wave was influential in moving softer lighting out of a area of it being a happy accident to a place where it is used on purpose, aldo was the main drive behind this.
	•	Cinematographers coming from a place of photography rather than the studio system this means they bring in skills from other disciplines (photojournalism) this also 


In the first Section I will be looking at Italian Neorealism, This due to its major influences upon European cinema, this is especially the realest movements Like the French New Wave and The Polish Film School movement.  One of the major ways Italian neorealism has influenced cinematography is in how it changed how realism was captured on camera heavily influencing the development of soft light as we know it today.

In this section I will be focusing on two major cinematographers during this time period, Ubaldo Arata and G.R. Aldo also known as Aldo Graziati. Both of these cinematographers have worked on films that were heavily influential in the evolution of soft light. I will be looking at the time period from 1940 till 1950 as this was the peak of Italy's “socially conscious film makers” [@deakinsWhenDidSoft2017], these filmmakers often used “existing situations as a backdrop they developed radically different ways to light and shoot.” [@deakinsWhenDidSoft2017] due to their limited resources at the time.
Ubaldo Arata
Ubaldo Arata began his career in the film industry as a camera operator and eventually worked his way up to become a cinematographer. His work includes some of the most influential Neorealist films made Rome Open City (1945), directed by Roberto Rossellini. Arata also worked on more mainstream Italian films like Black Magic (1949) Directed by Gregory Ratoff and starring Orson Welles.
Rome Open City (1945)

Rome Open City “was shot in the same way that conventional feature films were shot at the time” [@wagstaffItalianNeorealistCinema2007], However as it was filmed right after the Second World War the production didn’t have the resources required, for example “the interiors, mostly shot in a studio…. the filmmakers had no alternative but to use large amounts of artificial light” [@wagstaffItalianNeorealistCinema2007], This was a problem as “Arata found himself short of bulbs for the lighting units” [@wagstaffItalianNeorealistCinema2007], Arata was there for unable to light the film in “his sets in the normal way” [@wagstaffItalianNeorealistCinema2007], this resulted in an increased use of practical locations with very limited lighting and natural lighting was used for the studio sets like the gestapo headquarters.
For the “number of studio-shot scenes, particularly those in the Gestapo headquarters” (Salt, 1992:230) a shadow is clearly visible, For example behind the SS Officer in Figures {insert figure NO} and {second SS Figure}. The shadows are clearly indicative of the use of hard light as seen by the sharp shadow roll off.
##
When we contrast the interiors to the exteriors a few scenes earlier the story is completely different. The difference is clearly visible in Figure {insert EXT Rome}. The image appears far more naturalist due to it use of natural light, When discussing Rome Open City in Film Style and Technology, Salt states that the film used “kind of overcast day with grubby natural light that is ordinarily avoided” (Salt, 1992:230). Arata's origins are from a traditional background meaning he didn't necessarily want to film the exteriors this way however was limited due to financial reasons, this can be seen in a later film he worked on entitled Black Magic (1949) which had a far greater budget and was lit in more traditional manner with the use of harder lighting.
#
Although the lighting style of Rome Open City was out of necessity, “Its influence is seen as seminal upon the formation of the French New Wave directors. It has been seen as a spur to the growth of cinema-verité. And neorealism, as a genre, has fairly consistently enjoyed a reputation for marking a decisive change in the evolution of narrative cinema.” (Walsh, 1977), Jean-Luc Godard stating in a review that "all roads lead to Rome Open City." (Godard, 1959).
G.R. Aldo - Main Focus

G.R. Aldo also known as Aldo Graziati is considered to to be one of the the first cinematographers to start using soft light to create a natural image, During an interview in Masters of Light, Néstor Almendros discussed the look of Italian films during the neorealist movement talking about the use of Softer and more natural lighting, mentioning “Aldo was even before Raoul Coutard in using indirect lighting, using soft lighting” [@schaeferMastersLightConversations2013, 6] “He came to the cinema not through the usual way of the period” [@schaeferMastersLightConversations2013, 6] coming instead from a background of “still and theatrical photography” this resulted in his lighting style being “so unconventional for the period.” [@schaeferMastersLightConversations2013, 6] and resulted in his revolutionary work on Umberto D., (1952) and La terra trema, (1949).

Néstor Almendros also discussed where this softer lighting style might have originated. "Films of the period like Open City and Shoeshine made by other cinematographers had an interesting look, not because the director of photography wanted it that way; it was due to lack of money." [@schaeferMastersLightConversations2013, 5]

 “The third, Aldo Graziati, cinematographer for Vittorio De Sica’s Umberto D (1948) and Visconti’s La terra trema (The Earth Trembles, 1948), represents an exception, a case of the confluence of a strictly photographic culture in film (as well as a reconciliation between set photography and cinematography). Graziati was a professional photographer, though self-taught, who trained by studying the light of the paintings of Caravaggio and doing an apprenticeship in the photographic studios of Paris, first as a portraitist and then primarily as a set photographer.24 I will later briefly compare Graziati’s and Tonti’s contribution to Visconti’s cinema and the parallel evolution, in terms of documentary, of set photography, a practice that once again demands a close comparison of cinema and photography in those years.” (HIll and Minghelli, 2014, p. 194)

how did photojournalism influence cinematography

G.R. Aldo born in 1905 was one of the most influential cinematographers in italian neorealism, Aldo started his career out as a photojournalist

taking inspiration from his time working as a Photojournalism could be one of the reasons behind the look of his film this is seen in his works like La Terra Trema (1948) and

"The formation of many neo-realist cinematographers in the field of photojournalism or the newsreel should not be underestimated" [@hillStillnessMotionItaly2014, 194]



"Aldo was even before Raoul Coutard in using indirect lighting, using soft lighting. And I think that's because he came to motion pictures from still photography. He came to the cinema not through the usual way of the period, which was to be a loader, an assistant, a focus puller, a cameraoperator, and after all that, many years later becoming a director of photography. He came straight from still and theatrical photography and only because Visconti imposed on him. 

That's why his lighting was so unconventional for the period. 

He had not come down the same path. But he really was a source of inspiration. Other films of the period like Open City and Shoeshine made by other cinematographers had an interesting look not because the director of photography wanted it that way; it was due to lack of money. They looked interesting in spite of them. I'm sure that if they had given those cinematographers more money and technical support they would have done something very professional and slick." [@schaeferMastersLightConversations2013, 6]





"Visually, La Terra Trema is a very modern movie and Umberto Dis too, as well as Senso. Aldo photographed them." [@schaeferMastersLightConversations2013, 7]

La Terra Trema

 La Terra Trema (1948) directed by Luchino Visconti

“This could be because Arata had a limited number of floods available, and because Rossellini saved time by not cutting and changing set-ups when characters moved. These features are neither entirely a product of reduced resources nor an element of the poetics of ‘realism’: La terra trema is lit entirely differently, and far better, by G.R. Aldo, with fewer resources than were available to Arata (Aldo came from still photography, and it may be inappropriate to use his exceptional work as a comparison). No other neorealist film even approaches the bland sloppiness of the lighting of Roma città aperta in its highly lit scenes. Another stylistic characteristic of the film can be used in partial explanation of this frontal blandness of lighting. In a short while we shall see how Rossellini keeps his camera further back from the profilmic than is normal in cinema of the time. The further back the camera, the less freedom is offered the director of photography in placing his lights. He has to keep them out of the frame, and therefore at a certain distance from the objects they are illuminating,” (Wagstaff, 2007, p. 102)
“The style of La terra trema is complex,45 and Aldo Graziati’s photographic contribution, which dramatically sculpts each scene through strong contrasts of light, adds to Visconti’s theatrical setting in a progressive subordination of the ethnological phenomenon. However, like Sciuscià, La terra trema is marked by a series of “imagefacts” that are very similar in style and subject. These are the slow and semi-static portraits of the Valastro family, which are almost photographic. Between one portrait and the next runs the story of the events, which is told in pictures that are less visually significant than the frames which present the Valastros in everyday life, like fossils embedded among the stones of their simple dwellings.

“The working methods of neorealism offered a way to produce films without large financial resources. The stories of common men, often played by nonprofessional actors, inspired filmmakers in Europe such as the directors of the French New Wave school of the late 1950s and early 1960s championed by critic Andre Bazin, who were heavily influenced by Rossellini’s Paisan. Neorealism’s influence can also be seen in the Cinema Novo of Brazil, the Free Cinema of Britain, the Nova Vlna of Czechoslovakia, the Third Cinema of Argentina, in Egyptian neorealism, the Mexican films of Bunˇuel such as Los Olvidados/The Young and the Damned (1950), and even to the present day in the films from the emerging cinemas in countries with extremely strict censorship codes, for example, turn of the millennium Iran, or whenever a film/television serial is made based upon simple production values that attempt an objective depiction of everyday existence.”

French Cinema and its New Wave



Italian neorealism on the French New Wave was significant, and it helped to shape the movement's focus on realism and its rejection of traditional cinematic forms and conventions. This influence can be seen in the work of French New Wave filmmakers such as François Truffaut and Jean-Luc Godard, who were heavily influenced by Italian neorealism and its techniques and approaches

From 1950 to 1960, France was rife with artistic experimentation, including one of the most influential film movements. The Nouvelle Vague brought upon us the birth of auteur theory. In the age of experimental auteurs, there were also experimental cinematographers, most notably the likes of Raoul Coutard, Henri Decae and Léonce-Henri Burel.


Cinematographers not being part of film movements


“New Wave directors, Jean Luc Goddard or Francois Truffaut, had in turn been heavily influenced by Italian neorealism, especially Rossellini’s Paisan, which New Wave critic/founding father saw as a primal example of effective filmmaking.7 Truffaut’s The 400 Blows (1959) arguably has elements that recall De Sica’s The Children and Watching Us(1943).” (celli 105 a new guide to italian)


Raoul Coutard

I am going to prioritise eather Raoul Coutard or Léonce-Henri Burel - i need to figure out who of the two was more inspirational

@godardPetitSoldat1963

Coutard was known for his ability to work quickly and efficiently, and his use of natural light allowed him to shoot in a variety of locations without the need for heavy and expensive lighting equipment. His use of soft light was instrumental in the development of the French New Wave style of filmmaking.

"It might be hard to understand now but these films had a profound affect on European cinema. They inspired the French 'New Wave' of Goddard and Truffaut; the 'Kitchen Sink' realism of the 60's in the UK; the students of the Polish Film" [@deakinsWhenDidSoft2017]


Working with Goddard and Truffaut it was the cinematographer Raoul Coutard who really made this naturalistic approach to cinematography his signature 'style'. (Roger Deakins, 2017)


“But in Europe new trends were just beginning that eventually, towards the end of the’sixties, began to have their first effects on American lighting. The central figure in these radical changes was Raoul Coutard, not only in his work for Jean-Luc Godard, but also in the lighting he did for Francois Truffaut and other ‘Nouvelle Vague’ directors. One of the styles of interior lighting Coutard developed began with Godard’s next film after A bout de souffle, which was le Petit soldat made in 1960. In this film Coutard introduced the practice of bouncing light off the ceiling from rows of photoflood reflector bulbs fastened above the tops of window and door frames, and pointing upwards at the ceiling. This type of lightingmimics and boosts the natural light coming through the windows, etc., to a point where filming is possible with super-fast stock without giving it forced development. Also, because of the rather non-directional nature of this light, it permits filming from all directions during a long take without the lighting units getting into the shot. Advantage was taken of this in Le Petit soldat, sometimes in conjunction with hand-held moving camera. The drawback to this approach to lighting is that it only works well in all-white rooms, particularly in colour filming, and also that it tends to leave the eyes of the actors slightly shadowed. Associated with this last point is an absence of ‘catch lights’ showing in the actors’ eye-balls, which are those tiny reflections of the light sources which are conventionally considered to give ‘life’ to the actor’s expression in close shots. Bounce lighting is also a very inefficient method of lighting, owing to the large light losses on reflection, and two to four times the wattage is needed to achieve the same light level on the set as with ordinary direct lighting.” Salt, B. (1992) Film Style and Technology: History and Analysis. (s.l.): Starword. Page 253


“The interiors of Zorn Curtain were shot entirely in the studio on sets which had no ceilings, so the Coutard style of bounce lighting was out of the question. Instead, the horizontal beams of very large spotlights outside the walls of the sets were diffused downwards into the sets by bouncing them from large flats painted matt white and suspended at 45 degrees to the walls and above them. This rather elaborate procedure was never repeated, but it marks the beginning of the Hollywood interest in recent European cinematographic techniques.” Salt, B. (1992) Film Style and Technology: History and Analysis. (s.l.): Starword. Page 253, 254





Léonce-Henri Burel - Main Focus

Although Robert Bresson’s work is not thought to be part being part of the French New Wave, However it still was none the less highly influential in a multiple of ways, his way of lighting being one of them. The lighting in Bressons' films had evolved through multiple films and Cinematographers, two of the most notably being Philippe Agostini and Léonce-Henri Burel. Agostini's films with Bresson had softer elements with elements of softer lighting using the standard techniques of to achieve soft lighting. However, this changed with Bressons' collaboration with Léonce-Henri Burel where this technique was used to a far greater extent, most notably on the films Diary of a Country Priest (1951), A Man Escaped (1956) and Pickpocket (1959).


However, Bresson's work was distinctive and did not necessarily conform to the conventions of the French New Wave, so he is not always considered to be a part of this movement

he is often considered to be a filmmaker who worked outside of traditional film movements and developed his own unique style and approach to cinema

look at the catch light used in A Man Escaped and how it gave life to the image

the inefficiency of lights and how they aren't very light efficient so they need strong lights to power

(soft light was used since the beginning of cinema how)

A Man Escaped

(Fig. (). A Man Escaped 1956)


"With Un condamné à mort the principal stylistic problems stemmed from the locations chosen for the shoot: ‘[M]any scenes had to be shot in studio sets and these same scenes would begin or end in the real setting of the prison at Lyon’, notes Burel (Nogueira 1998: 517). He spent considerable time observing the lighting in the cell and then trying to repeat that light in the studio. Not only did the studio cell have to match the lighting of the actual cell at Lyon, but, because the location shots show the prisoners coming out of their cells into the gallery, a ‘correlation’ had to be created between the cell and the corridor, which on its own had more natural illumination than the cell. To create a more realistic feel ‘without artifice or dramatic effect’, Burel decided to ‘live dangerously by filming almost without light’ (Nogueira 1998: 517). He was therefore working within a relatively narrow range of error. The actual cell was lit with a fanlight (which is visible in a shot late in the film), so in order to duplicate its effect for the studio-shot elements, Burel used a technique uncommon for the period but which would catch on and be used by Pasqualino De Santis (1927–1996), DoP on L’Argent, and Coutard. ‘I think I was one of the first cameramen to use reflected instead of direct light’, he claims. He describes the technique further: I threw light on to a sort of large white shield, so that instead of falling directly on the actors it was reflected on to them. It became an ambiance, an atmosphere, and though directed, came not from a particular point but from an extensive surface. It was easy enough really because Bresson works so much in close-up and because there were never more than three actors in shot. With a big set or a wider field, I could never have done it." [@nogueiraBurelBresson1977, 518]


“I had to be extremely careful, too, because photographically speaking, I was living dangerously by filming almost without light.
When you are working within a comfortable range, a little more or a little less doesn't really matter; but when you're stuck at one end of the scale, then the slightest error can mean catastrophe. For the scenes with Fontaine and Jost in their cell, which is illuminated only by a fanlight, it would have been ridiculous to show them with shadows, especially as the fanlight is right above them.
As you don't actually see it until later, I wanted to suggest that the whole cell was illuminated by this fanlight you hadn't seen but which you would know was there. So I think I was one of the first cameramen to use reflected instead of direct light. I threw the light on to a sort of large white shield, so that instead of falling directly on the actors it was reflected on to them. It became an ambience, an atmosphere, and though directed, came not from a particular point but from an extensive surface. It was easy enough really because Bresson works so much in close-up and because there were never more than three actors in shot. With a big set or a wider field, I could never have done it.
When Fontaine comes out into the corri-dor, on the other hand, I used directional light to suggest illumination from much larger windows. Nothing was left to chance.
The escape scenes were shot at Montluc at the dead of night and I used an absolute minimum of light. Sometimes there's a bit of light and you can just barely see the two of them; but since there was almost nothing else on the screen, you knew they were there. Nogueira, R. (1977) 'Burel and Bresson' In: Monthly Film Bulletin 46 (1) Winter/1977 p.20.”


Pickpocket
##
(Fig. (). Pickpocket 1959)

“With Pickpocket (1959) the problem was different. Bresson wanted to film in the streets, as far as possible without anybody noticing. Whole sequences of the film, not just a few scenes. It would be easier now, but I had an idea I'm quite proud of. The first high-power lamps, which could be overrun to 2,800-3,000 watts, had just become available in France. In order to be able to use them, I hid car batteries to make up the 110 volts on a little camouflaged cart. After Bresson had rehearsed ten, fifteen, twenty times, my operator came along during the final rehearsal with his camera- -we were using a hand camera, an Arriflex-to check his focus and get a good look at the location and action. Then, as the take started, I switched on the lights I had previously hidden in trees or places like that where people wouldn't notice them. So, using the fastest available Gevaert stock, we were able to film almost candid camera style, because people didn't have time to realise what was going on. That way we got scenes around the Madeleine and the Opéra, the café in the Place Pigalle (part interior and part exterior, which was a problem), and the one at the corner of the Boulevard Saint Michel.Nogueira, R.

The British cinema and the Kitchen Sink


“It's interesting to look at the work of Geoffrey Unsworth and Ozzie Morris because they came out of the British studio system and their lighting styles was always a mix of old-school hard light and more modern soft-light techniques -- and then compare them with someone like David Watkin who came out of shooting industrials, documentaries, and commercials.  Also, look at Unsworth's work on "2001" (1968), which is mostly soft-lit - (David Mullen, 2017)


“One of the most striking features of British films during this period is the transformation in visual style: from a predominance of black and white to the ubiquity of colour; from hard-edged, high-contrast lighting to a softer, more diffused use of illumination; from carefully composed images and minimal camera movement to a much freer, more mobile and spontaneous visual register; from the aesthetics of classicism to a much more self-conscious use of form appropriate to a decade associated with a new emphasis on spectacle and sensation. This shift was driven by a number of factors including developments in technology and film-making practice, a continuing process within the industry towards independent production, and the influence of a wider cultural fermentation which stimulated new developments in other creative spheres including television, advertising, fashion, fine art and pop music. 

“Prior to the production of Zorba the Greek, Walter Lassally had made yet another major contribution to the development of British cinematography with his work on Tom Jones, a film which also marked the transition between the poetic austerity of the new wave and the emergence of the more colourful, exuberant and cosmopolitan cinema of ‘swinging London’. As noted above, Lassally approached this production in a similar freewheeling and self-conscious style. The vérité approach is in evidence throughout, with perhaps the highlight being the extended hunt sequence, beginning with the preparations, shot wild in a documentary style with three hand-held cameras, before moving into the chase, which combines low-angle travelling shots, including material filmed by Lassally from the back of a mini pick-up truck, with helicopter material providing an aerial overview of the horses and hounds. Tom Jones was also made in colour, which was considerably slower in comparison to black-and-white stocks – using Eastmancolor 5251, introduced in 1962 and rated at just 50 ASA. This was to remain the standard until the appearance of Eastmancolor 5254 in 1968 doubled the speed to 100 ASA. While this did not rule out flexible location shooting, more lighting was required to achieve a suitable exposure, particularly in the interiors. Ever the innovator, Lassally manipulated the colour to lower the contrast and create a softer and more pastel look by shooting everything through a net placed over the lens. This entailed a major risk, however, as the cinematographer acknowledges”: 
Petrie, D. (2018) 'A Changing Visual Landscape: British Cinematography in the 1960s' In: Journal of British Cinema and Television 15 (2) pp.204–227.

**The British kitchen sink drama movement emerged in the 1950s and 1960s, and was characterised by a focus on working-class characters and the harsh realities of life in industrial cities such as London and Manchester. Like Italian neorealism, the British kitchen sink drama movement sought to depict the world as it really was, without the glamorization or escapism of traditional British cinema. This movement was led by filmmakers such as Tony Richardson and Ken Loach, who were interested in using cinema to tell stories about the lives of ordinary people and to explore social and political issues of the time. Overall, while the direct influence of Italian neorealism on the British kitchen sink drama movement is difficult to determine, it is likely that the two movements shared some common influences and aesthetic approaches.**

**Some well-known examples of British kitchen sink films include Saturday Night and Sunday Morning, A Taste of Honey, and Look Back in Anger.**








“The modern lighting unit called a ‘soft light’ or ‘north light’ came into use for film lighting in 1967, prompted in part by the European use of bounce lighting, and in part by recent fashions in the lighting for commercial still photography. These soft lights were first marketed by Colortran in the form of a large sheet-metal box about three feet square on the open side, and with a very irregular interior surface painted matt white. Long quartz-iodine lamp tubes shone onto this surface from behind a narrow baffle that stopped them radiating light directly forward, and after a number of reflections from the white walls, the light emerged from the front opening of the box as a non-directional glow: indeed very like the light emerging through a north-facing window of rather small size. Different powers were available, from 1.25 kW. to SkW., and these lights quickly came to be widely used, but mainly in non-theatrical film-making.Salt, B. (1992) Film Style and Technology: History and Analysis. (s.l.): Starword. Page 255

John Alcott


**John Alcott's use of soft light was a key element of his approach to cinematography. In many of his films, Alcott used large, diffused light sources to create a soft and even lighting effect. This helped to create a more natural and realistic look in his films, and it allowed him to capture subtle details and textures in the actors' faces and costumes. Alcott was also known for his use of low-key lighting, which involved using relatively low levels of light to create a moody and atmospheric effect. This approach was particularly effective in The Shining, where Alcott used low-key lighting to create a sense of unease and tension. Overall, Alcott's use of soft light was an important part of his distinctive visual style, and it helped to make his films both visually striking and emotionally powerful.**

**Alcott used reflected light in many of his films with Kubrick, including 2001: A Space Odyssey and A Clockwork Orange. In these films, he used large softboxes and bounced light off of whthe walls and ceilings of the sets in order to create a soft and even lighting effect. This helped to create a more natural and realistic look in the films, and it allowed Alcott to capture subtle details and textures in the actors' faces and costumes.

Ozzie Morris' use of space lights and

"It's interesting to look at the work of Geoffrey Unsworth and Ozzie Morris because they came out of the British studio system and their lighting styles was always a mix of old-school hard light and more modern soft-light techniques -- and then compare them with someone like David Watkin who came out of shooting industrials, documentaries, and commercials. Also, look at Unsworth's work on "2001" (1968), which is mostly soft-lit"_ [@mullenWhenDidSoft2017]

**Ozzie Morris was a British cinematographer who was known for his use of soft light in his films. He began his career in the 1950s and worked on a number of films during this time, but it was his collaboration with director Carol Reed on the film Oliver! (1968) that brought him to prominence. Morris's use of soft light in this film helped to create a more natural and realistic look, and his lighting techniques were instrumental in defining the visual style of the film**



Geoffrey Unsworth

2001: A Space Odyssey

"It was the demands of such cinematographers for a softer look, especially in the shooting of commercials, that influenced what the film equipment manufacturers made rather than the other way around. The development of Space Lights made economical sense when film directors and cinematographers demanded their large interior stage sets looked real.  HMIs were invented because there was a demand for ever larger sources of light that could be softened down or bounced to appear more naturalistic. Much later new varieties of reflector materials were developed for Kubrick and cinematographer John Alcott." [@deakinsWhenDidSoft2017]





David Watkin
experimenting with large diffused light sources for sets.

“Yet another method of generating large-area soft lighting was also taken over from still photography and television commercials by David Watkin in his lighting of Peter Brook’s The Marat/Sade (1967). This technique did not involve any new lighting units, but was done by shininga bankof powerful conventional lights from fairly close range onto a largevertical sheet of translucentmaterial, which could be tracing paper or spun glass, and then using the diffuse light that struggled through it and emerged on the other side as the sole light source on the scene. In The Marat/Sade this source formed a whole glowing wall about thirty feet square just out of shot at one side of the set. A similar method was used to light a conference room set in 2001: A Space Odyssey, but after that the method tended to be restricted to window-sized areas in ordinary room sets.




“While a veteran may have pointed the way, the key innovations in soft lighting in British cinematography were to come from elsewhere. David Watkin had joined British Transport Films in 1949 before moving into the newly burgeoning sphere of television commercials in 1960. It was during this period that he developed an inclination for a particular style of illumination: 


“Partly as boredom relief, I thought an interesting way to light interiors was to use reflected light. I decided on one scene in a documentary with a housewife in Welwyn Garden City to aim a brute through the window and light the scene with reflected light, which looks better and is more natural if you know what you are doing. People poured shit on that for about five years and then started copying it!6


“After working with Richard Lester on a Shredded Wheat commercial, Watkin was invited to shoot the director's next feature, The Knack … And How to Get It (1965). While this early example of the cinema of ‘swinging London’ sported a predominantly naturalistic monochrome look, this was tinged with an edge of surrealism, notably during the ‘white-out’ sequence featuring a line of young women on the staircase leading to the bedroom of Tolen (Ray Brooks), the young man with the ‘Knack’. But despite the attempts to eschew excessive sculpting with light and shade, black and white continued to demand the use of contrast, and it took a shift into colour on Watkin and Lester's next collaboration, Help!, to facilitate the creation of a more overtly softer and diffused lighting style. Another Beatles showcase, the film included various zany set pieces – this time filmed in exotic foreign locations, ranging from the ski slopes of the Austrian Alps to the tropical beaches of the Bahamas, which added their own range of natural colours.


“Watkin's artistic preferences dovetailed with technical ingenuity and his solution to a tight shooting schedule and limited space on Peter Brook's production of Marat/Sade (1966) was to create a single lighting set-up comprising a translucent wall through which 26 10kW lamps were diffused. The soft illumination proved not only conducive to fast and efficient production, but the distortion of the outline of figures when backlit added to the unsettling intensity of the drama's setting in a lunatic asylum. For The Charge of the Light Brigade (1968), Watkin found other ways of experimenting with a diffused naturalism. The slowness of colour film stock meant that backgrounds and windows are allowed to burn out in order to ensure the correct exposure for the foreground action, which created a dreamy quality in romantic scenes featuring the dashing Captain Nolan (David Hemmings) and his fiancée (Vanessa Redgrave). When the action switched from England to the Crimea, Watkin utilised a greater depth of field which further enhanced the harsh realities of this notorious military catastrophe. But what also gave the film its distinctive look was the use of old Ross Express lenses, which Watkin had encountered when he started his career in documentary production: 


“They had been around since the early 1930s … and had a very beautiful and gentle quality to them. Also, they carried no coating or blooming, so that there would occur light refraction within the elements of the lens itself. When you put a net, a diffuser, or a fog filter in front of a lens it is an overall dead thing you are seeing through – whereas, inside the Ross lenses were constantly alive, giving rise sometimes to the most wonderful accidents. And accidents (of the right sort) are always the best things in photography. (Chase 1984)


“Thus Watkin effectively eschewed the properties of current technology in favour of a retro or antiquated effect, thus making the cinematography of The Charge of the Light Brigade a fascinating blend of modernity and nostalgia.”

Polish Film School Movement
Looking at how they also took influence from italian neorealism

The Polish Film School was a film movement that emerged in Poland during the 1950s. It was characterised by a focus on realism and social commentary in its storytelling, as well as a distinct visual style. The movement was influenced by Italian neorealism and the French New Wave

notable cinematographers who worked during the Polish Film School movement include Jerzy Wójcik, Edward Kłosiński, and Witold Sobociński. Wójcik is best known for his work on Andrzej Wajda's "Ashes and Diamonds," while Kłosiński is known for his collaborations with Krzysztof Zanussi, including on the film "Illumination." Sobociński, meanwhile, is known for his work on Wajda's "The Promised Land" and Zanussi's "The Constant Factor."

**The Polish Film School was a movement that began in the 1950s and lasted through the 1970s, during which time Polish filmmakers created a new, more realistic form of cinema. One of the key techniques used by these filmmakers was the use of soft light, which helped to create a more natural and realistic look in their films.** --&gt;

Witold Sobociński
**Witold Sobociński was a Polish cinematographer known for his use of soft light in his work. Sobociński often used diffused light sources to create a warm, atmospheric look in his films. This approach helped to create a sense of intimacy and emotional depth in his scenes. Sobociński's use of soft light was particularly notable in his collaborations with director Krzysztof Zanussi, including in the films "The Constant Factor" and "From a Far Country."**

The Promised Land

The Constant Factor



Ingmar Bergman
**Ingmar Bergman was a Swedish director and writer who is widely considered one of the greatest filmmakers of all time. He was known for his commitment to realism in his work, often depicting complex psychological states and interpersonal relationships with great attention to detail and accuracy. Bergman's films often explored themes of isolation, faith, and the human condition, and he was known for his willingness to tackle difficult and controversial subjects. He was particularly interested in exploring the inner workings of the human mind, and many of his films feature intense, intimate portrayals of characters struggling with their emotions and relationships. His use of realism was a key element of his storytelling, and helped to make his films powerful and enduring.**


**As a director, Ingmar Bergman worked with a number of different cinematographers throughout his career. Some of the most notable include Sven Nykvist, who worked on many of Bergman's most famous films, including "Persona" and "Fanny and Alexander"; Gunnar Fischer, who shot several of Bergman's early films, including "The Seventh Seal" and "Smiles of a Summer Night"; and Hilding Bladh, who collaborated with Bergman on several of his later films, including "Scenes from a Marriage" and "The Magic Flute". Other cinematographers who worked with Bergman include Gunnar Olsson, Mikael Graversen, and Jörgen Persson.** --&gt;

Sven Nykvist
worked with tarkofski


**Sven Nykvist was a Swedish cinematographer who was known for his innovative use of soft light in his film work. He believed that soft light was more natural and flattering to the human face, and he often used diffusers and other techniques to create a soft, diffuse look in his lighting setups.

**One of Nykvist's signature techniques was his use of overhead soft boxes, which he placed directly above the actors in order to create a diffuse, even light that wrapped around their faces and bodies. This helped to eliminate harsh shadows and create a more natural, lifelike look.**

**Nykvist also made extensive use of practicals, or lights that were integrated into the set design, to create a more immersive and believable world on screen. He believed that the use of practicals helped to create a sense of depth and dimension in a scene, and he often used them in combination with soft key lights to create a more natural, three-dimensional look.**

**Overall, Nykvist's contributions to the use of soft light in film have had a lasting impact on the way that films are lit and shot, and his techniques continue to be widely used by cinematographers today.****



Conclusion

Seperate cinematographers from the movments as they arnt liked to a spicific movement but more foucsing on films

cinematographers hope over the line and have more diversity

soft light is not inovative but to do it well does involve skill

soft light vs natural light

Muting the image: lighting and photochemical techniques of Bresson's cinematographers 
Some of this is duplicated - it talks about French and Pre French new wave
It mentions Agostini, Burel and Coutard

“This paper argues that Bresson’s productions were the site of creative solutions to unique photographic problems that led his cinematographers to develop bounce light and flashing techniques, as well as to use the 50 mm lens” (Burnett, 2007, p. 219)
“Marcel Martin, in his interview with Agostini, observes that he became ‘at a certain time the expert in lustrous, very soft images that deliberately play with halo and contre-jour effects’ (Martin 1976: 146).” (Burnett, 2007, p. 221)
“Martin describes ‘lighting typical of the “Agostini style” of the 40s’” (Burnett, 2007, p. 221)
“The subtle combination of a number of light sources’ that ‘both plays with cast shadow and gives a vigorous sense of relief to the decor’ – qualities on display in Les Anges du péché” (Burnett, 2007, p. 221) Angels of Sin (1943)
“He points out that the biggest danger of the time was producing images that were too harsh,” (Burnett, 2007, p. 221)
“Bresson’s cinematographers, indirect or reflected light.” (Burnett, 2007, p. 221)
“Agostini” (Burnett, 2007, p. 222) who?
“Bounce lighting was a European innovation and a practice that by the end of the 1960s would influence American techniques.” (Burnett, 2007, p. 223)
“The central figure in these radical changes was Raoul Coutard, not only in his work for Jean-Luc Godard, but also in the lighting he did for François Truffaut and other “Nouvelle Vague” directors’ (Salt 1983: 327).” (Burnett, 2007, p. 223)
“In Le Petit soldat/The Little Soldier (Godard 1963), Coutard ‘introduced’ the practice by bouncing light emanating from photoflood reflector bulbs pointing up at the ceiling. The upshot is twofold in that, aesthetically speaking, the ‘non-directional’ nature of the light would ‘mimic and boost’ natural light coming in from windo” (Burnett, 2007, p. 223)
“practically speaking, the development of the film would not have to be ‘forced’ if shot with ‘super-fast stock’ (Salt 1983: 327).” (Burnett, 2007, p. 223)
“would permit shooting in all directions without having to choreograph the movement and position of the lighting unit, therefore speeding up production. Indirect lighting of this kind did have drawbacks, however. Principal among them is an absence of ‘catch light’ used to ‘give life’ to actors’ faces, thus leaving their eyes ‘slightly shadowed’ (Salt 1983: 327).” (Burnett, 2007, p. 224)
“Salt indicates that this process was quite difficult to use at first, producing ‘the unfortunate result that the upper parts of the walls which are visible in the shot just below the lighting units and the top of the frame are brighter than the lower parts of the walls, and this looks rather unnatural’ (Salt 1983: 327)” (Burnett, 2007, p. 224) salt
“None of these constraints deterred Bresson’s cinematographers from using this and other indirect lighting techniques, and research indicates that they not only used it fruitfully but well before Coutard had the opportunity to.” (Burnett, 2007, p. 224) another thing indicating cuthard didnt do it first
“Agostini used indirect or reflected light as early as the 1940s, on such films as Les Portes de la nuit/Gates of the Night (1946) and Pattes blanches/ White Paws (1948). This suggests that while Coutard may have introduced bounce or reflected light techniques as the unique or dominant source of illumination in some of Godard’s early work,” (Burnett, 2007, p. 224)
“This suggests that while Coutard may have introduced bounce or reflected light techniques as the unique or dominant source of illumination in some of Godard’s early work, he certainly did not invent it. Indirect light was probably used in the 1940s as one technique among many to generate localized lighting effects, and probably not to light entire films or scenes on its own.” (Burnett, 2007, p. 224)
“Even if some doubt might be cast on whether Agostini used the technique consistently or to full effect, it is relatively certain that Salt’s account of the emergence and development of bounce light remains incomplete based on L.-H. Burel’s experimentation with it in the making of Un condamné à mort.” (Burnett, 2007, p. 225)
“Un condamné à mort” (Burnett, 2007, p. 225)
“‘I think I was one of the first cameramen to use reflected instead of direct light’, he claims. He describes the technique further: I threw light on to a sort of large white shield, so that instead of falling directly on the actors it was reflected on to them. It became an ambiance, an atmosphere, and though directed, came not from a particular point but from an extensive surface. It was easy enough really because Bresson works so much in close-up and because there were never more than three actors in shot. With a big set or a wider field, I could never have done it. (Burel in Nogueira 1998: 518)” (Burnett, 2007, p. 225)
“Agostini’s indirect lighting practices may predate Un condamné à mort, but he did not use them as exclusively or to as strong an effect as bounce light is used here. In all likelihood, Godard’s cinematographer knew Burel’s work quite well.” (Burnett, 2007, p. 225)
“Burel used more direct light sources to illuminate the corridors, in order ‘to suggest illumination from much larger windows’ (Burel in Nogueira 1998: 518)” (Burnett, 2007, p. 225) time saver
“In researching the available sources for this section, I discovered that Rui Nogueira’s Sight &amp; Sound interview with Burel is in fact simply an annexation and translation of passages from Burel’s book of memoirs, with sometimes slight, sometimes major modifications made to the manuscript.” (Burnett, 2007, p. 226)

“Bounce lighting was a European innovation and a practice that by the end of the 1960s would influence American techniques. As Salt comments: ‘The central figure in these radical changes was Raoul Coutard, not only in his work for Jean-Luc Godard, but also in the lighting he did for François Truffaut and other “Nouvelle Vague” directors’ (Salt 1983: 327). In Le Petit soldat/The Little Soldier (Godard 1963), Coutard ‘introduced’ the practice by bouncing light emanating from photoflood reflector bulbs pointing up at the ceiling. The upshot is twofold in that, aesthetically speaking, the ‘non-directional’ nature of the light would ‘mimic and boost’ natural light coming in from windows, and, practically speaking, the development of the film would not have to be ‘forced’ if shot with ‘super-fast stock’ (Salt 1983: 327). Moreover, the convenience of the equipment itself would permit shooting in all directions without having to choreograph the movement and position of the lighting unit, therefore speeding up production. Indirect lighting of this kind did have drawbacks, however. Principal among them is an absence of ‘catch light’ used to ‘give life’ to actors’ faces, thus leaving their eyes ‘slightly shadowed’ (Salt 1983: 327). Salt indicates that this process was quite difficult to use at first, producing ‘the unfortunate result that the upper parts of the walls which are visible in the shot just below the lighting units and the top of the frame are brighter than the lower parts of the walls, and this looks rather unnatural’ (Salt 1983: 327). 


“A further limitation is that this process only works at its optimum capacity in all-white rooms. None of these constraints deterred Bresson’s cinematographers from using this and other indirect lighting techniques, and research indicates that they not only used it fruitfully but well before Coutard had the opportunity to. 


“Agostini used indirect or reflected light as early as the 1940s, on such films as Les Portes de la nuit/Gates of the Night (1946) and Pattes blanches/ White Paws (1948). 

“This suggests that while Coutard may have introduced bounce or reflected light techniques as the unique or dominant source of illumination in some of Godard’s early work, he certainly did not invent it. Indirect light was probably used in the 1940s as one technique among many to generate localized lighting effects, and probably not to light entire films or scenes on its own. Bresson may have demanded ‘all-white sets’ for Les Anges du péché (Martin 1976: 148), but bounce light was probably not the lone light source. The film itself contains hard, geometrical shadowing among softer fill lighting, which confirms that indirect lighting was not used to illuminate entire sets. Moreover, the conditions of the studio-bound production of Les Anges make it so that bounce light, a technique tailored to shooting on location in rooms with ceilings, would have most likely been deemed impossible as a primary source of illumination, given available lighting and diffusion equipment.6 Even if some doubt might be cast on whether Agostini used the technique consistently or to full effect, it is relatively certain that Salt’s account of the emergence and development of bounce light remains incomplete based on L.-H. Burel’s experimentation with it in the making of Un condamné à mort.





USED Quotes

"The film industry in Italy was supported by Mussolini for propaganda purposes and it survived his fall. For a brief period these socially conscious film makers turned their attention to stories that concerned the lives of contemporary working people and in doing so throughout much of the classical style of filmmaking. Working on location and often using existing situations as a backdrop they developed radically different ways to light and shoot." [@deakinsWhenDidSoft2017]


Stillness in Motion: Italy, Photography, and the Meanings of Modernity
“What is more, the formation of many neo-realist cinematographers in the field of photojournalism or the newsreel should not be underestimated: two out of the three key names of cinematography of the period come from photography and the newsreel. These were, Aldo Tonti, who was a photojournalist before his cinematic debut and his great work on Luchino Visconti’s Ossessione (Obsession, 1943),23 and 


“Otello Martelli, director of photography on Rossellini’s Paisà (Paisan, 1946) and Giuseppe De Santis’s Riso Amaro (Bitter Rice, 1949), who worked at the Istituto Luce (responsible for newsreels) during the war. (HIll and Minghelli, 2014, p. 194)
Il sole sorge ancora (1946) Aldo Tonti Italian cinematogrpher we are not talking about not to be confused with GR aldo

“Il sole sorge ancora also benefited from Aldo Tonti's cinematography. Tonti, like Vergano, had worked in the prewar Italian professional cinema in films such as Alessandrini's Abuna Messias, Visconti's Ossessione/Obsession (1943), and De Sica's wartime film La porta del cielo/The Gate of Heaven (1946). In each of these films Tonti overcame conditions that would presage the methods and stylistic necessities of neorealism. For example, Abuna Messias was shot on location in the Cobbu plain and Cercer mountain chain in Ethiopia. Ossessione (1943) is often cited as the first neorealist film not only because of the subject matter but also because of the unadorned quality of its photography.

“Filming on La porta del cielo took place under precarious conditions in Nazi occupied Rome. Under Tonti's influence Il sole sorge ancora has a rough newsreel quality that would become a neorealist common place and was adopted as a cinematic style by Pontecorvo. Pontecorvo's early documentaries Missione Timiriazev (1953), about a flood on the Po river, Cani dietro le barre (1954) about dog kennels in Rome, Pane e zolfo (1956) about the closing of sulfur mines; were made in the style and influence of neorealism which favored a stark, unadorned cinematography. This style would carry over into Pontecorvo's features such as Giovanna (1956) and especially in Battle of Algiers (1966), which actually had to be advertised as a film that did not use newsreel footage. Audiences assumed it was a documentary film because of Pontecorvo's mimicry of a documentary style.

Rome open city
"Roma città aperta was shot in the same way that conventional feature films were shot at the time, mostly in a studio. However, the production was ‘poor’ for purely historical reasons: electrical power and production funding were scarce and unreliable. The ‘look’ of a film is largely the product of the lighting. For the interiors, mostly shot in a studio, the filmmakers had no alternative but to use large amounts of artificial light, and one problem they faced was that of getting power for the lighting units. 
They had a generator, but fuel was hard to obtain. Once they had solved the problem by purloining current from a nearby American forces newspaper office, there was no reason why the DP should not light his sets in the normal way (except that Arata found himself short of bulbs for the lighting units)." [@wagstaffItalianNeorealistCinema2007]



Nevertheless it was still a very influential film for movements to come 





using more soft light from diffusing and moulding natural light _I don’t actually know how this was done and would need to research a lot more into it, finding direct quotes to cover this section



Although it was by accident the look of Rome open City heavily influenced realist films to come.

 looks and feel like a documentary this is mostly due to  



Roberto Rossellini
Italian Neorealist Cinema: An Aesthetic Approach

From watching rome open city i dont think it was as innovative, it was shot quite traditionally but due to the limitation at the time did inspire people to change the way they worked for example G.R Aldo with (insert film here)

Rome open city did shoot a lot outdoors using natural light however I don't feel it evolved soft lighting very much however it is still a good starting point to see where the industry evolved to become.

I feel the film is a good example of the worlds limitation affecting a cinematographer which resulted in the given look 

Most of the inteiros would definitely not be considered naturalist 

I need to find a direct quote saying that rome open city had an influence on the increased use of soft lighting 


“The third reason why viewers might reach for words like ‘documentary’ to describe Roma città aperta is more closely related to a style of filming: they recognize in the film signifying practices that they associate with documentary, and perceive in the film an absence of the signifying practices they associate with feature films. For example, we have grown so accustomed in feature films to a lighting convention in which main lights, fill light, top light, back light, and the judicious blending of hard and soft light are used to enhance the beauty of the actors, and to pick them out from their background that we interpret any absence of, or falling away from, this convention as a movement in the direction of documentary, which, we assume, does not apply these signifying practices.” (Wagstaff, 2007, p. 98)

“ In the case of Roma citta aperta, it is important to realize that it contains a number of studio-shot scenes, particularly those in the Gestapo headquarters, and in these the lighting has the polish one would expect from a European film of this vintage, which is slightly less than that in an American film. The location scenes in Roma - citta aperta are lit with only a very few lights, but these are still carefully disposed to produce reasonably attractive lighting, though without any backlighting. The roughness in these scenes is in what is lit rather than the way light is applied. But it is in the exteriors, always the crucial test of finesse in applying extra artificial light, that the lighting of this film is crudest. The fill light is just bashed straight on from the front, and in some Long Shots there is none at all, even though they are taken on the kind of overcast day with grubby natural light that is ordinarily avoided, or if not avoided, then sharpened with artificial light. However, it must be noted that these observations are not a judgement on the total aesthetic value of this lighting in the context of this film.” Salt, B. (1992) Film Style and Technology: History and Analysis. (s.l.): Starword. pg230

“ his move to location filming was an aesthetic choice, no doubt induced by the experience of all concerned with documentary film in World War 2, and the move was made in the first place with the technical equipment already available in such films as Roma citta aperta(1945) Salt, B. (1992) Film Style and Technology: History and Analysis. (s.l.): Starword. pg229

!table(KEYWORD)

These tags will be replaced with numbers in the compiled document, with the numbering stream for figures being separate from the numbering stream for tables.

You can refer to such tags as follows:

#fig(KEYWORD)
#table(KEYWORD)

Here’s an example:

Table !table(sales): Sales 2011
Table !table(dates): Shipment dates
Figure !fig(skeleton): The skeleton of the gnu.
Figure !fig(malcolmreynolds): The second coolest character in Firefly.

… (For sales figures, see table #table(sales))… For shipment dates, see table #table(dates)… where he discovered the skeleton of a gnarled gnu (see figure #fig(skeleton))… Chronicles providing a similar role, albeit without the Castle actor (see figure #fig(malcolmreynolds)).

In the compiled document, the above text would look like this:

Table 1: Sales 2011
Table 2: Shipment dates
Figure 1: The skeleton of the gnu.
Figure 2: The second coolest character in Firefly.

… (For sales figures, see table 1)… For shipment dates, see table 2… where he discovered the skeleton of a gnarled gnu (see figure 1)… Chronicles providing a similar role, albeit without the Castle actor (see figure 2).

Compiling
	•	Go to File &gt; Compile…
	•	Ensure the “Chicago Essay” format is selected in the list of formats on the left of the Compile panel.
	•	Be sure to fill in information such as author and title in the metadata pane (click on the tag icon in the right-most header bar of Compile).
	•	If you wish footnotes to be exported as endnotes, click on the gear icon in the right-most header bar of Compile and tick both “Export inspector footnotes as endnotes” and “Export inline footnotes as endnotes”. (Be sure to remove the “Notes” document if you do this.)
	•	Click “Compile”.

Adjusting This Template
	•	If you don’t require a separate title page but instead need the title and course information as the header of the first page, remove the “Title Page” document from the “Essay” folder and replace it with the “First Page Header” document, which you can find inside the “Miscellaneous” folder.
	•	This template uses Times New Roman as the font. If you require a different font, such as Arial or Courier, in the Compile panel, simply change the “Font” setting at the top of the “Section Layouts” pane.

Sample Document
The “Example Essay” PDF file in the Research folder shows how the essay will look when compiled.

Final Note
Scrivener project templates are flexible and are not intended to restrict you to a particular workflow. You can change, delete or move the files and folders contained in the template to suit how you work.

Like all templates in Scrivener, this project was originally created from the “Blank” template. We’ve simply added a few folders and set everything up in ways that should be useful to students. Everything you can do with this project, you could equally do by creating a “Blank” project and setting it up yourself.

You can create your own templates by setting up a skeletal project with the files, folders and settings you would like to use for new projects and using File &gt; Save As Template.</Text>
