  {"id":"beachHiddenHistoryFilm2015","abstract":"The image that appears on the movie screen is the direct and tangible result of the joint efforts of the director and the cinematographer. A Hidden History of Film Style is the first study to focus on the collaborations between directors and cinematographers, a partnership that has played a crucial role in American cinema since the early years of the silent era. Christopher Beach argues that an understanding of the complex director-cinematographer collaboration offers an important model that challenges the pervasive conventional concept of director as auteur. Drawing upon oral histories, early industry trade journals, and other primary materials, Beach examines key innovations like deep focus, color, and digital cinematography, and in doing so produces an exceptionally clear history of the craft. Through analysis of several key collaborations in American cinema from the silent era to the late twentieth century—such as those of D. W. Griffith and Billy Bitzer, William Wyler and Gregg Toland, and Alfred Hitchcock and Robert Burks—this pivotal book underlines the importance of cinematographers to both the development of cinematic technique and the expression of visual style in film.","author":[{"family":"Beach","given":"Christopher"}],"citation-key":"beachHiddenHistoryFilm2015","ISBN":"978-0-520-28435-7","issued":{"date-parts":[[2015,5]]},"language":"en","number-of-pages":"246","publisher":"Univ of California Press","source":"Google Books","title":"A Hidden History of Film Style: Cinematographers, Directors, and the Collaborative Process","title-short":"A Hidden History of Film Style","type":"book"},

These \"empire films\" were Italy's entry into an international market for the exotic. The films engaged its most experienced and cosmopolitan directors (Augusto Genina, Mario Camerini) as well as new filmmakers (Roberto Rossellini) who would make their marks in the postwar years. Ben-Ghiat sees these films as part of the aesthetic development that would lead to neo-realism. Shot in Libya, Somalia, and Ethiopia, these movies reinforced Fascist racial and labor policies and were largely forgotten after the war.

  {"id":"bernardiWritingLightSilent2001","abstract":"While most people associate Japanese film with modern directors like Akira Kurosawa, Japan's cinema has a rich tradition going back to the silent era. Japan's \"pure film movement\" of the 1910s is widely held to mark the birth of film theory as we know it and is a touchstone for historians of early cinema. Yet this work has been difficult to access because so few prints have been preserved. Joanne Bernardi offers the first book-length study of this important era, recovering a body of lost film and establishing its significance in the development of Japanese cinema. Building on a wealth of original-language sources—much of it translated here for the first time—she examines how the movement challenged the industry's dependence on pre-existing stage repertories, preference for lecturers of intertitles, and the use of female impersonators.Bernardi provides in-depth analysis of key scripts—The Glory of Life, A Father's Tears, Amateur Club, and The Lust of the White Serpent—and includes translations in an appendix. These films offer case studies for understanding the craft of screenwriting during the silent era and shed light on such issues as genre, authorship and control, and gender representation.Writing in Light helps fill important gaps in the history of Japanese silent cinema. By identifying points at which \"pure film\" discourse merges with changing international trends and attitudes toward film, it offers an important resource for film, literary, and cultural historians.","author":[{"family":"Bernardi","given":"Joanne"}],"citation-key":"bernardiWritingLightSilent2001","ISBN":"978-0-8143-2961-0","issued":{"date-parts":[[2001]]},"language":"en","number-of-pages":"366","publisher":"Wayne State University Press","source":"Google Books","title":"Writing in Light: The Silent Scenario and the Japanese Pure Film Movement","title-short":"Writing in Light","type":"book"},
  {"id":"blankFilmLightHistory2015","abstract":"A comprehensive history of film lighting, from its earliest origins to the heyday of Hollywood dominance - and beyond. This is a book about the art of lighting, \"the relevance of pictures, and the responsibility of all those who take pictures of the world and show them\". In an age of constant digital snapshots, with their mercilessly artless recording of everything around us, the award-winning director and scriptwriter Richard Blank makes a compelling case for this increasingly neglected art, and for sustaining \"the awareness of its responsibility\". In Film & Light, Richard Blank draws on examples from a century of pioneering filmmakers - from Griffith to Buñuel, Ophüls to Altman, Rossellini to Scorsese, Eisenstein to Wong Kar-Wai - to trace the historical development of lighting technology, analyse the changing \"rules\" and techniques of film lighting, and define the key terms surrounding the technical innovations of its art. The close attention he brings to bear on these modern masters - from DeMille to De Sica to Lars von Trier, Niblo to Murnau to Siodmark, via Maurice Tourneur and Fritz Lang, Charlie Chaplin and Orson Welles - brilliantly illuminates the hidden art of these past masters, as well as the troubled social context by which they each variously came to shine.","author":[{"family":"Blank","given":"Richard"}],"citation-key":"blankFilmLightHistory2015","ISBN":"978-3-89581-394-8","issued":{"date-parts":[[2015,9,16]]},"language":"en","number-of-pages":"308","publisher":"Alexander Verlag Berlin","source":"Google Books","title":"Film & Light: The History of Filmlighting is the History of Film","title-short":"Film & Light","type":"book"},

Because of the sharp, well-defined shadows it creates, it's fairly simple to place objects - such as flags - into its path to cut light off of areas you don't want it to hit. Putting flags in front of a soft source, however, can be a lot like trying to stop an ocean wave with a 2x4. Because light is scattering in all directions, getting a clean, sharp cut from a soft source ranges from difficult to impossible. The Inverse-Square Law & Photometries As there is a direct relationship between quality of light and distance to the source, we start to touch upon a law of physics called the inverse-square law, which states that the energy (of light, in this case) will diminish by the square of the distance traveled. Intensity = 1/d2 The formula and physics technically only apply to point sources; these are sources without lenses to focus the light, without diffusion, and that derive from a single point - like tungsten or HMI lamps, as opposed to fluorescent (a large light source that is not one point) or LED (a multiple-point source).","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,9,2]]},"author":[{"family":"Holben","given":"Jay"}],"citation-key":"holbenLightQuality1012020","container-title":"American Cinematographer","event-place":"Hollywood, United States","ISSN":"00027928","issue":"10/11","issued":{"date-parts":[[2020,11]]},"language":"English","license":"Copyright American Society of Cinematographers Oct/Nov 2020","number-of-pages":"16-20,22,24","page":"16-20,22,24","publisher":"American Society of Cinematographers","publisher-place":"Hollywood, United States","section":"SHOT CRAFT","source":"ProQuest","title":"Light Quality 101","type":"article-magazine","URL":"https://www.proquest.com/docview/2455894566/abstract/B4BB106683044E6FPQ/1","volume":"101"},

  {"id":"marcusItalianFilmLight1986","abstract":"The movement known as neorealism lasted seven years, generated only twenty-one films, failed at the box office, and fell short of its didactic and aesthetic aspirations. Yet it exerted such a profound influence on Italian cinema that all the best postwar directors had to come to terms with it, whether in seeming imitation (the early Olmi), in commercial exploitation (the middle Comencini) or in ostensible rejection (the recent Tavianis). Despite the reactionary pressures of the marketplace and the highly personalized visions of Fellini, Antonioni. And Visconti, Italian cinema has maintained its moral commitment to use the medium in socially responsible ways--if not to change the world, as the first neorealists hoped, then at least to move filmgoers to face the pressing economic, political, and human problems in their midst. From Rossellini's Open City (1945) to the Taviani brothers' Night of the Shooting Stars (1982).

  {"id":"miyaoAestheticsShadowLighting2013","abstract":"In this revealing study, Daisuke Miyao explores \"the aesthetics of shadow\"\nin Japanese cinema in the first half of the twentieth century. This term,\ncoined by the production designer Yoshino Nobutaka, refers to the\nperception that shadows add depth and mystery. Miyao analyzes how this\nnotion became naturalized as the representation of beauty in Japanese\nfilms, situating Japanese cinema within transnational film history. He\nexamines the significant roles lighting played in distinguishing the\nstyles of Japanese film from American and European film and the ways that\nlighting facilitated the formulation of a coherent new Japanese cultural\ntradition. Miyao discusses the influences of Hollywood and German cinema\nalongside Japanese Kabuki theater lighting traditions and the emergence of\nneon commercial lighting during this period. He argues that lighting\ntechnology in cinema had been structured by the conflicts of modernity in\nJapan, including capitalist transitions in the film industry, the\narticulation of Japanese cultural and national identity, and increased\nsubjectivity for individuals. By focusing on the understudied element of\nfilm lighting and treating cinematographers and lighting designers as\nessential collaborators in moviemaking, Miyao offers a rereading of\nJapanese film history.","author":[{"family":"Miyao","given":"Daisuke"}],"citation-key":"miyaoAestheticsShadowLighting2013","ISBN":"978-0-8223-5422-2","issued":{"date-parts":[[2013,3,4]]},"number-of-pages":"381","publisher":"Duke University Press","title":"The Aesthetics of Shadow: Lighting and Japanese Cinema","type":"book","URL":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=kjb7E1bQUv4C"},

  {"id":"nelsonKubrickFilmArtist2000","abstract":"Stanley Kubrick ranks among the most important American film makers of his generation, but his work is often misunderstood because it is widely diverse in subject matter and seems to lack thematic and tonal consistency. Thomas Nelson's perceptive and comprehensive study of Kubrick rescues him from the hostility of auteurist critics and discovers the roots of a Kubrickian aesthetic, which Nelson defines as the \"aesthetics of contingency.\" After analyzing how this aesthetic develops and manifests itself in the early works, Nelson devotes individual chapters to Lolita, Dr. Stangelove, 2001: A Space Odyssey, A Clockwork Orange, Barry Lyndon, and The Shining. For this expanded edition, Nelson has added chapters on Full Metal Jacket and Eyes Wide Shut, and, in the wake of the director's death, reconsidered his body of work as a whole. By placing Kubrick in a historical and theoretical context, this study is a reliable guide into—and out of—Stanley Kubrick's cinematic maze.","author":[{"family":"Nelson","given":"Thomas Allen"}],"citation-key":"nelsonKubrickFilmArtist2000","ISBN":"978-0-253-21390-7","issued":{"date-parts":[[2000]]},"language":"en","number-of-pages":"352","publisher":"Indiana University Press","source":"Google Books","title":"Kubrick, Inside a Film Artist's Maze","type":"book"},

  {"id":"oprayModellingLightDark2004","abstract":"It is perhaps opportune at this point to raise the question of black-and-white film. In some ways it is an addendum, or at least a detour, but at the same time, because of its accent on the visual, it also seems quite germane. Most of the films discussed in this book, with the exception of Vertigo, The Searchers and The Red Desert, were shot in black-and-white. My bias was not a conscious one. It was determined by my tastes and by the fact that many of the generally accepted film classics were made in the black-and-white era. It may even be the case that black-and-white cinema constitutes a stylistic category, one that crosses national boundaries, genres and even artists. My emphasis has been on Eisenstein’s cinema, Dreyer, Italian neo-realism, Hitchcock and Ford, in all of whom black-and-white cinematography plays a large part. The monochromaticism of cinema’s greatest achievements (I am excluding early tinted film)2 includes the major films of Eisenstein, much of Ford, Hitchcock, Wilder, Capra, Welles, Hawks, Fuller, the two Rays, Pabst, Lang, Renoir, Mizoguchi, Vertov, Vigo, Bunuel, Deren, Dreyer, Ozu — the list is endless. In other words, the classic cinema of both Hollywood and international art cinema remains defined largely by works shot in black and white.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,8,23]]},"author":[{"family":"O’Pray","given":"Michael"}],"citation-key":"oprayModellingLightDark2004","collection-title":"Language, Discourse, Society","container-title":"Film, Form and Phantasy: Adrian Stokes and Film Aesthetics","DOI":"10.1057/9780230535770_10","editor":[{"family":"O’Pray","given":"Michael"}],"event-place":"London","ISBN":"978-0-230-53577-0","issued":{"date-parts":[[2004]]},"language":"en","page":"185-212","publisher":"Palgrave Macmillan UK","publisher-place":"London","source":"Springer Link","title":"Modelling in Light and Dark","type":"chapter","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1057/9780230535770_10"},

  {"id":"wagstaffItalianNeorealistCinema2007","abstract":"The end of the Second World War saw the emergence of neorealist film in Italy. In Italian Neorealist Cinema, Christopher Wagstaff analyses three neorealist films that have had significant influence on filmmakers around the world. Wagstaff treats these films as assemblies of sounds and images rather than as representations of historical reality. If Roberto Rossellini&#39;s Roma città aperta and Paisà, and Vittorio De Sica&#39;s Ladri di biciclette are still, half a century after they were made, among the most highly valued artefacts in the history of cinema, Wagstaff suggests that this could be due to the aesthetic and rhetorical qualities of their assembled narratives, performances, locations, lighting, sound, mise en scène, and montage. This volume begins by situating neorealist cinema in its historical, industrial, commercial and cultural context, and makes available for the first time a large amount of data on post-war Italian cinema. Wagstaff offers a theoretical discussion of what it means to treat realist films as aesthetic artefacts before moving on to the core of the book, which consists of three studies of the films under discussion. Italian Neorealist Cinema not only offers readers in Film Studies and Italian Studies a radically new perspective on neorealist cinema and the Italian art cinema that followed it, but theorises and applies a method of close analysis of film texts for those interested in aesthetics and rhetoric, as well as cinema in general.","author":[{"family":"Wagstaff","given":"Christopher"}],"citation-key":"wagstaffItalianNeorealistCinema2007","ISBN":"978-0-8020-9520-6","issued":{"date-parts":[[2007,1,1]]},"language":"en","number-of-pages":"537","publisher":"University of Toronto Press","source":"Google Books","title":"Italian Neorealist Cinema: An Aesthetic Approach","title-short":"Italian Neorealist Cinema","type":"book"},
