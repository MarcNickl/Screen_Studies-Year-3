# Introduction


## What is soft light?


### What is soft light? But smaller

"_The closer the source is to your subject, the softer the light will be. As light becomes softer, the shadow transition becomes longer and more gradual. Soft light is, by its nature, very low in contrast_. It can be non-directional and even feel "sourceless," meaning that it's hard to determine what direction the light is coming from. It can hide the texture of an object, even at extreme angles. Extremely soft light can create a nearly shadowless environment." @holbenLightQuality1012020 



### what are the non artistic benifts
faster setups and better continuity


# Italian Neo Realism 
During an interview in Masters of Light, Néstor Almendros discussed the look of Italian films during the neorealist movement talking about the use of Softer and more natural lighting, mentioning G.R. Aldo (born Aldo Graziati) as one of the most influential people during this time because of his revolutionary work on Umberto D., (1952) and La terra trema, (1949)

Néstor Almendros also discussed where this softer lighting style might have originated "Films of the period like Open City and Shoeshine made by other cinematographers had an interesting look, not because the director of photography wanted it that way; it was due to lack of money." [@schaeferMastersLightConversations2013, 5]






# Post War France Cinema

From 1950 to 1960, France was rife with artistic experimentation, including one of the most influential film movements. The Nouvelle Vague brought upon us the birth of auteur theory. In the age of experimental auteurs, there were also experimental cinematographers, most notably the likes of Raoul Coutard, Henri Decae and Léonce-Henri Burel. 

Although Robert Bresson’s work is not thought to be part being part of the French New Wave, However it still was none the less highly influential in a multiple of ways, his way of lighting being one of them. The lighting in Bressons' films had evolved though multiple films and Cinematographers, two of the most notably being Philippe Agostini and Léonce-Henri Burel. Agostini's films with Bresson had softer elements with elements of softer lighting using the standard techniques of to achieve soft lighting. However, this change with Bressons' collaboration with Léonce-Henri Burel where this technique was used to a far greater extent, most notably on the films Diary of a Country Priest (1951), A Man Escaped (1956) and Pickpocket (1959).

look at the catch light used in A Man Escaped and how it gave life to the image

the ineficency of lights and how they arnt very light efficent so they need stong lights to power

> _"It's interesting to look at the work of Geoffrey Unsworth and Ozzie Morris because they came out of the British studio system and their lighting styles was always a mix of old-school hard light and more modern soft-light techniques -- and then compare them with someone like David Watkin who came out of shooting industrials, documentaries, and commercials. Also, look at Unsworth's work on "2001" (1968), which is mostly soft-lit" [@davidmullenWhenDidSoft2017]_
